        <p>
         Let <m>Y</m> be a subset of the topological space <m>X</m>. A collection <m>\mathcal{A}=\{A_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a <term> covering </term> of <m>Y</m> if <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i</m>. As a shorthand, we will often say in this case that <m>Y=\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i</m> is a covering. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Given a property of subsets (<eg/>, open, closed, <etc/>), a covering <m>\mathcal{A}=\{A_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is said to satisfy this property if <m>A_i</m> does for all <m>i\in I</m>.

  <statement>
    <p>
      A topological space <m>X</m> is <term>compact</term> if every open covering of <m>X</m> has a finite subcovering: <ie/>, if <m>X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m> is an open covering, then there is a finite set <m>\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n\}\subseteq I</m> such that <m>X=\bigcup_{j=1}^n U_{i_j}</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A subset <m>Y\subseteq X</m> is compact if it is compact with respect to the subspace topology. Equivalently, <m>Y</m> is compact if any covering <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i</m> by open sets of <m>X</m> has a finite subcovering.

        If <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is a homeomorphism, then <m>X</m> is compact if and only if <m>Y</m> is compact. Indeed <m>f</m> defines a bijection

    <title>Finite closed intervals are compact</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
        Finite closed intervals <m>[a,b]</m> are compact in <m>\R</m>. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            Let <m>\mathcal{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be an open covering of <m>[a,b]</m>. Define <m>A</m> to be the set of all <m>x\in [a,b]</m> such that <m>[a, x]\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m> has a finite subcovering. Note that <m>A</m> is nonempty, since clearly <m>a\in A</m>. I will show further that <m>A</m> is open and closed in <m>[a,b]</m>. Since <m>[a,b]</m> is connected, it will follows that <m>A=[a,b]</m>, and hence that <m>[a,b]\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m> has a finite subcovering, as desired. 
        </p>
        <case>
            <title><m>A</m> is open</title>
            <p>
                Suppose <m>c\in A</m>. By definition of <m>A</m> there is a finite subcover <m>[a,c]\subseteq\bigcup_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume that <m>c\in U_{i_1}</m>. Since <m>U_{i_1}</m> is open, we can find an <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m> such that <m>U=(c-\epsilon, c+\epsilon)\cap (a,b)\subseteq U_{i_1}</m>. But then clearly 
                <m>[a,x]\subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}</m> for all <m>x\in U</m>, showing that <m>[a,x]</m> admits a finite subcovering for all such <m>x</m>, and hence that  <m>U\subseteq A</m>. This proves <m>A</m> is open. 
            </p>
        </case>
        <case>
            <title><m>A</m> is closed</title>
            <p>
                Take <m>c\in [a,b]-A</m>. Since <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a cover of <m>[a,b]</m>, we have <m>c\in U_{i_0}</m> for some <m>i_0\in I</m>.  Since <m>U_{i_0}</m> is open, we can find an <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m> such that <m>U=(c-\epsilon, c+\epsilon)\cap (a,b)\subseteq U_{i_0}</m>. But then for all <m>x\in U</m> we have <m>x\notin A</m>: indeed, if for such an <m>x</m> we had a finite subcovering <m>[a,x]\subseteq\bigcup_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}</m>, then <m>[a,c]\subseteq U_{i_0}\cup \bigcup_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}</m> would be a finite subcovering of <m>[a,c]</m>, contradicting the fact that <m>c\notin A</m>.

        <p>
            (1) follows directly from (2). To prove the latter, note that for each <m>y\in Y</m> we can find disjoint open neighborhoods <m>U_{x,y}, V_y</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. Since <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{y\in Y}V_y</m> is an open covering of <m>Y</m>, there is a finite subcovering <m>Y\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^nV_{y_i}</m>. The open sets
