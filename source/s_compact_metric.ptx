  <title>Compactness in metric spaces</title>
  <p>
    As useful as the Heine-Borel theorem is in characterizing compactness in <m>\R^n</m>, it relies in part on a <em>non-topological property</em>: namely, boundedness with respect to the Euclidean, box, or taxicab norm. In this section we investigate the relation of compactness to various related topological properties that turn out to be equivalent to compactness in the setting of metric spaces. First we meet our new compact-like properties.

    <title>Compactness in metric spaces</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
           Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space. The following statements are equivalent. 
           <ol>
            <li>

  <p>
    Our proof of <xref ref="th_compact_metric"/> will involve a series of results that articulate which implications hold between these three concepts in full generality, and highlight what extra conditions are required to obtain equivalences. Before embarking on this investigation we look at two examples that illustrate two different uses of <xref ref="th_compact_metric"/>: namely, (a) deciding whether a given subset of a metric space is compact, and (b) showing that a given space is not a metric space.

  <theorem xml:id="th_compact_implies_limitpoint">
    <title>Compact implies limit point compact</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
        If <m>X</m> is compact, then <m>X</m> is limit point compact. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an infinite subset of <m>X</m>, and let <m>A'=\{x_1,x_2,\dots\}</m> be any countable infinite subset of <m>A</m>. We will show that <m>A'</m> has a limit point. Assume by contradiction that <m>A'</m> has no limit point. Since in general the closure of a set is obtained by adding all limit points, we see that <m>A'</m> is closed. Since <m>X</m> is compact, we conclude that <m>A'</m> is compact. On the other hand, since no element of <m>A'</m> is a limit point of <m>A'</m> is a limit point of <m>A'</m>, it is easy to see that all singletons of <m>A'</m> are open in the subspace topology. This contradicts the compactness of <m>A'</m> since the open covering <m>A'=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\{x_n\}</m> has no finite subcover.

  </theorem>
  <remark xml:id="rm_countably_compact">
    <title>Countably compact space</title>
    <p>
      A close look at our proof of <xref ref="th_compact_implies_limitpoint"/> reveals that limit point compactness follows from a slightly weaker notion of compactness: namely, <em>countable compactness</em>. A space is <term>countably compact</term> if every countable open subcover has a finite subcover. We have the following implications:
      <me>
        X \text{ compact} \implies X \text{ countably compact} \implies X \text{ limit point compact}
      </me>.
      It can be shown that none of these implications is in fact an equivalence. However, if <m>X</m> is further assumed to be <m>T_1</m>, then limit point compactness implies countable compactness. We record this fact schematically as follows: 
      <me>
        X \text{ limit point compact} \underset{(T_1)}{\implies} X \text{ countably compact}
      </me>.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <theorem xml:id="th_seqcompact_implies_limitpoint_compact">
    <title>Sequential compactness implies limit point compactness</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>X</m> is sequentially compact, then <m>X</m> is limit point compactness. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We will show that sequential compactness implies countable compactness. The result then follows from <xref ref="rm_countably_compact"/>. Suppose by contradiction that the open covering <m>X=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n</m> has no finite subcover. It follows that we can construct a sequence <m>(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> satisfying <m>x_n\notin U_1\cup U_2\cup \cdots \cup U_n</m>. By sequential compactness there is a convergent subsequence <m>x_{n_m}\rightarrow x</m>. Since <m>\{U_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a covering, we have <m>x\in U_{N}</m> for some <m>N</m>. But by construction there is an <m>M</m> such that <m>x_{n_m}\notin U_N</m> for all <m>m\geq M</m>. A contradiction. Thus there must be a finite subcover of <m>\{U_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m>.  
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    At this point we have the following logical diagram for a general topological space. Without further assumptions on <m>X</m> none of the implications below is an equivalence.

        Assume <m>X</m> is second countable, and let <m>X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i</m>.

    Finally, we are ready to prove <xref ref="th_compact_metric"/>. Since any metric space <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m> and first countable, we have <m>(1)\implies (2)\implies (3)</m>. To show <m>(3)\implies (1)</m> it suffices to prove that any sequentially compact metric space is second countable. This is the result of our last theorem. 
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="th_metric_sequential_second_countable">
    <title>Metrizable+sequentially compact implies second countable</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space. If <m>X</m> is sequentially compact, then <m>X</m> is second countable. 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show first that if <m>X</m> is a sequentially compact metric space, then it is totally bounded: <ie/>, given any <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>, we have
        <me>
          X=\bigcup_{i=1}^n B_\epsilon(x_i)
        </me>
        for some elements <m>\{x_i\colon 1\leq i\leq n\}</m>. Indeed, suppose by contradiction that there is an <m>\epsilon</m> for which this is not true. Construct a sequence as follows: choose any <m>x_1\in X</m>; since <m>B_\epsilon(x_1)\ne X</m>, we can find an element <m>x_2\notin B_\epsilon(x_2)</m>; in general, given choices <m>x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n</m>, choose 
        <me>x_{n+1}\notin B_\epsilon(x_1)\cup B_{\epsilon}(x_2)\cup\cdots \cup B_{\epsilon}(x_n)</me>.
        Since <m>X</m> is sequentially compact the the sequence <m>(x_n)_{n\in \Z_+}</m> has a convergent subsequence <m>(x_{n_k})_{k\in \Z_+}</m>. This is a contradiction since this sequence would not be Cauchy: indeed by construction, for any <m>n_j</m> and <m>n_k</m> with <m>n_k &gt; n_j</m>, we have <m>x_{n_k}\notin B_\epsilon(n_j)</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>X</m> is totally bounded, for each <m>n\in \Z_+</m> we have 
        <me>
          X=\bigcup_{i=1}^_{m_n} B_{1/n}(x_{n,i})
        </me>.
        Let <m>Q=\{x_{n,i}\colon n\in \Z_+, 1\leq i\leq m_n\}</m>, a countable set. It is easy to see that <m>Q</m> is dense in <m>X</m>: <ie/>, <m>\overline{Q}=X</m>. As we will show in <xref ref="th_second_countable"/>, any metric space containing a countable dense subset is second countable.

      Prove: the Cantor set is nonempty, Hausdorff, compact, <term>perfect</term> (closed and all points of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> are limit points of <m>\mathcal{C}</m>), and <term>totally disconnected</term> (the connected components of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> are singletons).  
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>[0,1]</m> is compact, and since <m>\{C_n\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> is a collection of nested nonempty closed sets, we know by <xref ref="cor_finite_intersection"/> that <m>\mathcal{C}\ne \emptyset</m>.  Since each <m>C_n</m> is clearly closed, <m>\mathcal{C}=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n</m> is closed and bounded, hence compact. Since <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is a subspace of a Hausdorff space, it is Hausdorff. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We show that <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is perfect. We know already that <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is closed. Given any <m>x\in \mathcal{C}</m> and <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>, pick <m>N\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>1/3^N&lt; \epsilon</m>. Since <m>x\in C_{N}</m>, we have <m>x\in I=[a_k/3^N, (a_k+1)/3^N]</m> for some <m>a_k\in \{0,1,\dots, 3^N-1\}</m>. Let <m>J, K</m> be the two subintervals of <m>I</m> remaining after deleting its middle third. Assume without loss of generality that <m>x\in J</m>. The collection <m>\{C_n\cap K\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is itself a family of nested, closed and nonempty subsets of <m>[0,1]</m>. Again by compactness, there is an element <m>y\in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty (C_n\cap K)\subseteq \mathcal{C}</m>. Since <m>x,y\in I</m>, we have <m>d(x,y)\leq 1/3^N&lt; \epsilon</m>. Since <m>x\in J</m> and <m>y\in K</m>, and since <m>J\cap K=\emptyset</m>, we have <m>x\ne y</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We prove <m>\mathcal{C}</m> is totally disconnected. Let <m>A</m> be any subset of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> containing two distinct elements <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We will find a nontrivial separation of <m>A</m>. Since <m>x\ne y</m>, we can find an <m>n</m> and disjoint intervals <m>I_{n,j}=[a_j/3^n, (a_j+1)/3^n], I_{n,k}=[a_k/3^n, (a_k+1)/3^n]</m> such that <m>x\in I_{n,j}</m> and <m>y\in I_{n,k}</m>: otherwise we would have <m>d(x,y)\leq 1/3^n</m> for all <m>n</m>, which would imply <m>d(x,y)=0</m>. Assume without loss of generality that <m>a_j&lt; a_k</m>, and let <m>b</m> be any element between <m>a_j</m> and <m>a_k</m> that does not lie in <m>C_n</m>. The open sets <m>U=A\cap [0,b)</m> and <m>V=A\cap (b,1]</m> form a separation of <m>A</m>, proving it is not connected. We conclude that the only connected subsets of <m>\mathcal{C}</m> are singletons, and thus that the connected components are singletons.
