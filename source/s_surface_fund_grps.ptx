            Let <m>n</m> be a nonnegative integer. A <term>topological <m>n</m>-manifold</term> is a topological space <m>M</m> satisfying the following properties:

<remark>
    <p>
        You might be wondering whether an <m>m</m>-manifold could also be an <m>n</m>-manifold. The answer is no, but hinges on the fact that <m>\R^m</m> is not homeomorphic to <m>\R^n</m> (invariance of domain), which is difficult to prove in full generality. However, we do know that invariance of domain holds for <m>\R^1</m> and <m>\R^2</m> (homework exercise), so the <m>n</m> in <m>n</m>-manifold is well-defined at least for <m>n=1,2</m>.
