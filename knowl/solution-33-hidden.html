<div class="para">Recall first that on <span class="process-math">\(\R^2=\R\times \R\)</span> the product topology, Euclidean metric topology, and box topology are all equal. Since <span class="process-math">\(f_1(x)=\cos 2\pi t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_2(x)=\sin 2\pi t\)</span> are continuous, it follows from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_product_universal_prop.html" title="Theorem 2.10.6: Universal property of product space">TheoremÂ 2.10.6</a> that the map <span class="process-math">\(g\colon [0,1)\rightarrow \R\times \R=\R^2\)</span> is continuous. Next, since <span class="process-math">\(g=i\circ f\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(i\colon S^1\hookrightarrow \R^2\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous: indeed, for any open set <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq S^1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(U=U'\cap S^1\)</span> for some open <span class="process-math">\(U'\subseteq \R^2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(U')\text{,}\)</span> which is open since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is continuous.</div> <div class="para">The usual trigonometric arguments show that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is injective and surjective. However, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not open, and hence not a homeomorphism. Indeed, let <span class="process-math">\(U=[0,1/2)\text{,}\)</span> which is open in <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\text{.}\)</span> The image <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> is easily seen to be the upper half of the circle minus the point <span class="process-math">\(Q=(-1,0)\text{:}\)</span> in particular, all points <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> have nonnegative <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinates. On the other hand, we have <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\in f(U)\)</span> and with respect to the subspace topology on <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> any open set containing <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\)</span> contains elements of <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> whose <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinate is negative. It follows that <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> is not open.</div>
