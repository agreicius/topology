<span class="process-math">\((a)\implies (b)\text{.}\)</span> Assume <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a quotient map. Let <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq X\)</span> be open and saturated. Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a quotient map, to show <span class="process-math">\(V=f(U)\)</span> is open, it is enough to show <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(f(U))\)</span> is open. I claim <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(f(U))=U\text{,}\)</span> whence the claim follows. In general for any function of sets we have <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(f(U))\supseteq U\text{.}\)</span> (Check for yourself.) Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is saturated, the reverse inclusion also holds. Indeed, if <span class="process-math">\(x\in f^{-1}(f(U))\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\in f(U)\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=f(u)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(u\in U\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is saturated, we have <span class="process-math">\(x\in U\text{.}\)</span>

I claim <span class="process-math">\(f(U)=f(f^{-1}(V))=V\text{,}\)</span> showing <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is open. In general we always have <span class="process-math">\(f(f^{-1}(V))\subseteq V\)</span> for any function of sets.

</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((b)\implies (c)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be a saturated closed map. First I claim that the open set <span class="process-math">\(U=X-C\)</span> is saturated. To see why, suppose <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(x\in U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\notin C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is saturated, we must have <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\subseteq U\text{,}\)</span> as desired. Next, I claim <span class="process-math">\(f(U)=Y-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> We have already seen that if <span class="process-math">\(y\in f(U)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(y\notin f(C)\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\subseteq Y-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> For the other inclusion, given any <span class="process-math">\(y\in Y-f(C)\text{,}\)</span> by surjectivity there is some <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=y\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(y\notin f(C)\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(x\in U\text{;}\)</span> thus <span class="process-math">\(y\in f(U)\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(f(U)=X-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> satisfies (b), <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> is open. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f(C)\)</span> is closed, as desired.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((c)\implies (b)\text{.}\)</span> This argument is essentially identical to the one above.</div></article></details><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="s_quotients.html#th_quotientmap_props">in-context</a></span>
