<div class="para">Consider the map <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> defined by composition <div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/eg_quot_g.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is the quotient map from <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R/\Z\text{.}\)</span> It is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is surjective and satisfies <span class="process-math">\(g(t)=g(t')\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(t=t'\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(t,t'\in \{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span> From <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_quotientspace_props.html" title="Corollary 2.11.7: Mapping property of quotients">CorollaryÂ 2.11.7</a> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> gives rise to a bijective continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\colon X^*\rightarrow \R/\Z\text{.}\)</span> Concretely, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes an equivalence class <span class="process-math">\([t]\in X^*\)</span> and maps it to the equivalence class <span class="process-math">\(\{t+n\colon n\in \Z\}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R/\Z\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, to show <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a homeomorphism it is enough to prove that <span class="process-math">\(g\colon [0,1]\rightarrow \R/\Z\)</span> is a quotient map. In fact, we can show that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a closed map. Take a closed set <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq [0,1]\text{.}\)</span> To show its image <span class="process-math">\(g(C)\)</span> is closed in <span class="process-math">\(\R/Z\text{,}\)</span> we need only show, using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is a quotient map, that <span class="process-math">\(q^{-1}(g(C))\)</span> is closed in <span class="process-math">\(\R/\Z\text{.}\)</span> We have <span class="process-math">\(q^{-1}(g(C))=C+\Z=\{c+n\colon c\in C, n\in \Z\}\text{.}\)</span> This set is the result of starting with our original closed set <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq [0,1]\)</span> and taking the union of translated copies of the form <span class="process-math">\(C+n\subseteq [n,n+1]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\in \Z\text{.}\)</span> It is easy to see that each translate <span class="process-math">\(C+n\)</span> is closed; since furthermore <span class="process-math">\(C+n\subseteq [n,n+1]\text{,}\)</span> it follows that the union is also closed. I'll leave the details to you.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_quotients.html#li-239" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
