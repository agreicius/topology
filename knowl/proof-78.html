<div class="para">Implication: <span class="process-math">\((\Rightarrow)\text{.}\)</span> Assume <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is completely regular. Recall that in particular this means <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span> Define <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> to be the set of all pairs <span class="process-math">\((x, U)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is an open neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(i=(x,U)\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(f_i\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]\)</span> be a function satisfying <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(X-U)=\{0\}\text{.}\)</span> (Such a function exists since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is completely regular.) Now, for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and for all open sets <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> corresponding to the index <span class="process-math">\(i=(x,U)\)</span> we have the function <span class="process-math">\(f_i\)</span> which satisfies <span class="process-math">\(f_i(x)=1&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_i(X-U)=\{0\}\text{.}\)</span> We conclude by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_embedding_theorem.html" title="Theorem 1.22.2: Embedding theorem">Theorem 1.22.2</a> that the map <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=(f_i(x))_{i\in I}\)</span> is an embedding of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\text{,}\)</span> and thus that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is homeomorphic to a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Implication: <span class="process-math">\((\impliedby)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is completely regular, and since complete regularity is preserved under arbitrary products, the space <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\)</span> is completely regular for any set <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, since complete regularity is inherited by subspaces, any subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\)</span> is completely regular. Thus, if <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> embeds into <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\text{,}\)</span> then it is homeomorphic to a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^I\text{,}\)</span> and hence is completely regular.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_Urysohn_metrization.html#proof-78" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
