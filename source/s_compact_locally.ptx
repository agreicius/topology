    <statement>
        <p>
           Let <m>X</m> be a topological space. The following are equivalent. 
           <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>X</m> is locally compact Hausdorff. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For all <m>x\in X</m>, and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an open neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>x</m> such that <m>\overline{V}\subseteq U</m> and <m>\overline{V}</m> is compact.

            </li>
           </ol> 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            It is clear that (2) implies (1): for any <m>x\in X</m>, taking <m>U=X</m>, we get an open neighborhood <m>V\ni x</m> such that <m>\overline{V}</m> is compact. Thus <m>K</m> is a compact neighborhood of <m>x</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We now show (1) implies (2). Fix an <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>. Since <m>X</m> is locally compact, we have <m>x\in U'\subseteq K</m> for some open set <m>U'</m> and compact set <m>K</m>. Taking <m>U'\cap U</m> we may assume further that <m>U'\subseteq U</m>. The set <m>C=K-U</m> is a closed subset of the compact set <m>K</m>, hence compact. Since <m>X</m> is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint open sets <m>V', W'</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>C</m>, respectively. (See <xref ref="th_compact_Haus_closed"/>.) Let <m>V=V'\cap U'</m>. Since <m>V\subseteq U'\subseteq K</m>, we have <m>\overline{V}\subseteq K</m>; since <m>K</m> is compact, it follows that <m>\overline{V}</m> is compact. To show <m>\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>, it suffices to show that <m>\overline{V}\cap C=K-U</m> is empty. Given any <m>y\in C=K-U</m>, the open set <m>W'</m> contains <m>y</m> and is disjoint from <m>V</m>; we conclude that <m>x\notin \overline{V}</m>. In all we have shown that for any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an open set <m>V</m> with compact closure <m>\overline{V}</m> satisfying <m>x\in V\subseteq\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>, as desired.

Next, we have <m>K\subseteq X\cap \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i=\bigcup_{i\in I}V_i</m> where <m>V_i=X\cap U_i</m> is open in <m>X</m>. Since <m>K</m> is compact, there is a finite subcovering <m>K\subseteq \bigcup_{j=1}^nV_{i_j}</m>; then we have <m>X^*=U_{i_0}\cup \bigcup_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}</m>, a finite subcovering of <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m>.

Now since <m>X^*</m> is compact, if <m>X</m> is closed, then <m>X</m> is compact. Suppose conversely that <m>X</m> is compact; then by definition of <m>\mathcal{T}^*</m> the set <m>X^*-X=\{p_\infty\}</m> is open. The stated equivalences now follow.

        <p>
            If <m>X^*</m> is Hausdorff, then since <m>X^*</m> is also compact, we see that <m>X</m> is an open subspace of a locally compact Hausdorff space. The claim now follows from the general fact that an open subspace of a locally compact Hausdorff space is locally compact Hausdorff. This is easy to prove using <xref ref="th_locally_compact_equivalence"/>, and is left to the reader. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume conversely that <m>X</m> is locally compact Hausdorff. Since <m>X</m> itself is Hausdorff and is an open subspace of <m>X^*</m>, to show <m>X^*</m> is Hausdorff it suffices to show that given any <m>x\in X</m>, there are open disjoint sets <m>U,V\in\mathcal{T}^*</m> such that <m>x\in U</m> and <m>p_\infty\in V</m>. Since <m>X</m> is locally compact Hausdorff, there a closed compact neighborhood <m>K</m> of <m>x</m>. It follows that the open sets <m>U=K^\circ\in \mathcal{T}\subseteq \mathcal{T}^*</m> and <m>V=X^*-K\in \mathcal{T}^*</m> meet the desired conditions.

        Let <m>P=(0,0,1)</m>, the <q>north pole</q> of <m>S^2</m>. Given any <m>Q=(a,b,c)\in S^2-\{P\}</m> the line <m>\ell</m> passing through <m>Q</m> and <m>P</m> intersects the <m>xy</m>-plane in the unique point <m>Q'=(a/(1-c), b/(1-c),0)</m>. The corresponding map 
        <md>
            <mrow> \phi\colon S^2-\{P\} \amp \rightarrow \R^2</mrow>
            <mrow>(a,b,c) \amp \mapsto (a/(1-c), b/(1-c))</mrow>
        </md>
        can easily be shown to be a homeomorphism, with inverse 
        <md>
            <mrow>\psi\colon \R^2 \amp \mapsto S^2-\{P\}</mrow>
            <mrow>(x,y) \amp \mapsto \left(\frac{2x}{x^2+y^2+1},\frac{2y}{x^2+y^2+1}, \frac{x^2+y^2-1}{x^2+y^2+1}\right)</mrow>
        </md>.
    The map <m>\phi</m> is called the <term>stereographic projection</term> onto <m>\R^2</m>. The open embedding <m>\psi\colon \R^2\hookrightarrow S^2</m> realizes <m>S^2</m> as the one-point compactification of <m>\R^2</m>.

    Not surprisingly, this result generalizes easily to <m>\R^n</m>. There is a homeomorphism from <m>S^n-\{(0,0,\dots, 1)</m> to <m>\R^n</m> mapping <m>Q=(a_0,a_1,\dots, a_n)</m> to <m>(a_0/(1-a_n), a_1/(a_n-1),\dots, a_{n-1}/(a_n-1)</m>, whose inverse realizes <m>S^n</m> as the one-point compactification of <m>\R^n</m>.
