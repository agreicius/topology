<div class="para">Note: the argument for the forward direction uses the axiom of choice potentially.

</div>
<div class="para">Inversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous, then there is an <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and open set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> such that for all open sets <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> there is an element <span class="process-math">\(y_V=f(x_V)\in f(V)\cap (Y-U)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> be the set of all open neighborhoods of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with partial ordering given by reverse inclusion, and consider the net <span class="process-math">\((x_V)_{V\in I}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_V\)</span> is the element described above.

<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is Hausdorff and that the net <span class="process-math">\((x_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> converges to <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\text{.}\)</span> Given any <span class="process-math">\(y\ne x\text{,}\)</span> pick disjoint open sets <span class="process-math">\(U, V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively.

<div class="para">Now assume that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is not Hausdorff, as witnessed by elements <span class="process-math">\(x\ne y\in X\text{:}\)</span> this means for all open sets <span class="process-math">\(U, V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively, we have have <span class="process-math">\(U\cap V\ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> be the set of all triples <span class="process-math">\((U,V, z)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(U, V\)</span> are open neighborhoods of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively, and <span class="process-math">\(z\in U\cap V\text{.}\)</span> Declare <span class="process-math">\((U,V,z)\leq (U',V', z')\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(U\supseteq U'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V\supseteq V'\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is directed: given <span class="process-math">\(i=(U, V, z_i), j=(U',V',z_j)\in I\text{,}\)</span> we can take <span class="process-math">\(k=(U\cap U, V\cap V', z_k)\text{,}\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(z_k\in U\cap U'\cap V\cap V'\text{.}\)</span> Now, let <span class="process-math">\(f=(z_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> be the net in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> defined as follows: given <span class="process-math">\(i=(U, V,z)\text{,}\)</span> define <span class="process-math">\(f(i)=z\text{.}\)</span> I claim that <span class="process-math">\(z_i\rightarrow x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_i\rightarrow y\text{.}\)</span> Indeed given any open set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and open set <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> there is an element <span class="process-math">\(z\in U\cap V\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(i_0=(U,V,z)\in I\text{.}\)</span> For any <span class="process-math">\(i'=(U',V', z')\geq i_0\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(f(i')=z'\in U'\cap V'\subseteq U\cap V\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f=(z_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> is eventually in <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and eventually in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> as desired.</div>
