Recall that in particular this means <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span> Define <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> to be the set of all pairs <span class="process-math">\((x, U)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is an open neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(i=(x,U)\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(f_i\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]\)</span> be a function satisfying <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(X-U)=\{0\}\text{.}\)</span> (Such a function exists since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is completely regular.)
