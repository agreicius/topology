<span class="process-math">\((b)\implies (c)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be a saturated closed map. First I claim that the open set <span class="process-math">\(U=X-C\)</span> is saturated. To see why, suppose <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(x\in U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\notin C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is saturated, we must have <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\subseteq U\text{,}\)</span> as desired. Next, I claim <span class="process-math">\(f(U)=Y-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> We have already seen that if <span class="process-math">\(y\in f(U)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\{y\})\cap C=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(y\notin f(C)\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\subseteq Y-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> For the other inclusion, given any <span class="process-math">\(y\in Y-f(C)\text{,}\)</span> by surjectivity there is some <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=y\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(y\notin f(C)\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(x\in U\text{;}\)</span> thus <span class="process-math">\(y\in f(U)\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(f(U)=X-f(C)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> satisfies (b), <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> is open.
