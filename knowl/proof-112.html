<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> is compact, and since <span class="process-math">\(\{C_n\}_{n=0}^\infty\)</span> is a collection of nested nonempty closed sets, we know by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_finite_intersection.html" title="Corollary 2.15.14: Nested closed sets in compact space">CorollaryÂ 2.15.14</a> that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span>  Since each <span class="process-math">\(C_n\)</span> is clearly closed, <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\)</span> is closed and bounded, hence compact. Since <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a subspace of a Hausdorff space, it is Hausdorff.</div> <div class="para">We show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is perfect. We know already that <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is closed. Given any <span class="process-math">\(x\in \mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\text{,}\)</span> pick <span class="process-math">\(N\in \Z_+\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(1/3^N&lt; \epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\in C_{N}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(x\in I=[a_k/3^N, (a_k+1)/3^N]\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(a_k\in \{0,1,\dots, 3^N-1\}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(J, K\)</span> be the two subintervals of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> remaining after deleting its middle third. Assume without loss of generality that <span class="process-math">\(x\in J\text{.}\)</span> The collection <span class="process-math">\(\{C_n\cap K\}_{n=1}^\infty\)</span> is itself a family of nested, closed and nonempty subsets of <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span> Again by compactness, there is an element <span class="process-math">\(y\in \bigcap_{n=0}^\infty (C_n\cap K)\subseteq \mathcal{C}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x,y\in I\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(d(x,y)\leq 1/3^N&lt; \epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\in J\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\in K\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(J\cap K=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(x\ne y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We prove <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is totally disconnected.
