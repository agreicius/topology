<title>Separation axioms</title>
<p>
    The properties of being <m>T_1</m>, Hausdorff, regular, or normal are called <em>separation axioms</em> as they articulate how various subsets can be separated by open sets. Below you find the descriptions of these properties using the <foreign>Trennungsaxiom</foreign> schema.
    <me>
        \begin{array}{r|l}
        \text{Name} \amp T_n \\
        \hline 
        T_1 \amp T_1 \\
        \text{Hausdorff} \amp T_2 \\ 
        \text{Regular} \amp T_3 \\ 
        \text{Normal} \amp T_4
        \end{array}
    </me>
    A further remark about the use of <q>regular</q> and <q>normal</q> in the literature: some texts do not include the <m>T_1</m> condition in these notions, and describe the properties we define as <q>regular Hausdorff</q> and <q>normal regular</q>. There is considerably less ambiguity in the literature when using the <m>T_n</m> descriptions, but you should still be careful.

    <title>Trennungsaxiom implications</title>
    <p>
        It is easy to see that <m>T_4\implies T_3\implies T_2\implies T_1</m>. Furthermore, your argument for the first two implications will reveal why the <m>T_1</m> condition is needed.

        <p>
            Since the <m>K</m>-topology is finer than the standard topology on <m>\R</m>, <m>\R_K</m> is Hausdorff. To see that it is not regular, recall that <m>K=\{1/n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> is closed. I'll show that we cannot separate <m>0</m> and <m>K</m> with open sets. Indeed, suppose we have open disjoint sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>0, K</m> respectively. Since <m>U</m> is open, it must contain an open basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>0</m>; and since <m>U\cap K=\emptyset</m>, this basis element can be chosen of the form <m>(-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K</m>. Now choose <m>n\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>1/n\in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)</m>. Since <m>1/n\in K</m> we can find a basis element of the form <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)</m> that is contained in <m>V</m>. Furthermore, shrinking <m>\delta</m> if necessary, we can assume that <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\subseteq (-\epsilon, \epsilon)</m>. But then clearly <m>(1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\cap \left((-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K\right)\ne\emptyset</m>, and hence also <m>U\cap V\ne \emptyset</m>. Contradiction!

                        First, assume <m>X</m> is regular. Given <m>x</m> and <m>U</m> as described, we can separate <m>\{x\}</m> and the closed set <m>C=X-U</m> by open sets <m>V</m> and <m>V'</m>.

                        Conversely, assume for all <m>x\in X</m> and open sets <m>U\ni x</m> we can find an open set <m>V</m> satisfying <m>x\in V\subseteq\overline{V}\subseteq U</m>. Given any closed set <m>C</m> and element <m>x\notin X</m>, letting <m>U=X-C</m>, we see that there is an open set <m>V</m> satisfying <m>x\in V\subseteq \overline{V}\subseteq U</m>.

            See Munkres for the full proof. I'll content myself with a discussion of some of the key elements. First, let <m>D=\{(x,-x)\colon x\in\R\}\subseteq \R_\ell^2</m>. This set is closed in <m>\R^2</m>, and hence closed in <m>\R_\ell^2</m>, since the left limit product topology is finer than the standard topology. Next, as we saw on a previous homework, <m>D</m> is discrete as a subspace of <m>\R_\ell^2</m>: if follows that every subset of <m>D</m>, being itself closed in <m>D</m>, is closed in <m>\R_\ell^2</m>, using transitivity.

            </md>.
            By what we said above, the disjoint sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are closed in <m>\R_\ell^2</m>, but as it turns out you cannot separate them by open sets. The proof is not terribly difficult, but will seem somewhat convoluted without knowing about the Baire category theorem. As such, I omit it. (Munkres doesn't use this approach, choosing instead a proof by contradiction, but he outlines a proof in one of his exercises.)

        <p>
            Assume <m>X</m> is regular and second countable. Let <m>\mathcal{B}=\{B_n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> be a countable basis for <m>X</m>. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be disjoint closed sets. By regularity, for each <m>a\in A</m> we can find disjoint open sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>a</m> and <m>B</m> respectively. Since <m>\mathcal{B}</m> is a basis, we can find a basis element <m>B_{n_a}</m> such that <m>a\in B_{n_a}\subseteq \overline{B_{n_a}}\subseteq X-B</m>. The set of all such <m>B_{n_a}</m> is a countable subset of <m>\mathcal{B}</m>, giving rise to a countable cover <m>A\subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n</m> satisfying <m>\overline{U_n}\subseteq X-B</m> for all <m>n</m>. Similarly, we can construct an open covering <m>B\subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n</m> satisfying <m>\overline{V_n}\subseteq X-A</m> for all <m>n</m>. The corresponding open sets are not necessarily disjoint. However the sets <m>U=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U_n'</m> and <m>V=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n'</m>, where

            still cover <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> respectively, are still open, and are disjoint.
