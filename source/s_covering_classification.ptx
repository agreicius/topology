            Let <m>B</m> be path connected and locally path connected. If <m>p\colon E\rightarrow B</m> is a covering map and <m>E</m> is simply connected, then <m>p</m> is called a <term>universal covering</term> of <m>B</m>, and <m>E</m> is called the <term>universal covering space</term> of <m>B</m>.

 <remark>
 <title>Universal covering space is locally path connected</title>
    <p>
        If <m>B</m> is path connected and locally path connected and <m>p\colon E\rightarrow B</m> where <m>E</m> is path connected, then it turns out that <m>E</m> is also locally path connected (thanks to <m>p</m> being a covering map). Thus a universal covering space of <m>B</m> is automatically path connected (since it is simply connected) and locally path connected (thanks to the covering map <m>p</m>). 
    </p>

    <p>
        Let <m>p\colon (E,e_0)\rightarrow (B,b_0)</m> be a universal covering.
    </p>
    <p>
         If <m>p'\colon (E',e_0')\rightarrow (B,b_0)</m> is another universal covering, then we have <m>\pi_1(E,e_0)=\pi_1(E',e_0')=\{e\}</m> and thus <m>p_*(\pi_1(E,e_0))=p_*'(\pi_1(E', e_0'))=\{e\}</m>. It follows from <xref ref="th_covering_spaces"/> that <m>E</m> and <m>E'</m> are equivalent as covering spaces . This justifies the <q>the</q> in <xref ref="d_universal_covering_space"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, given <em>any</em> covering <m>p'\colon (E',e_0')\rightarrow (B,b_0)</m>, since <me>p_*(\pi_1(E,e_0))=\{e\}\subseteq p_*'(\pi_1(E',e_0'))</me>, 
        <xref ref="cor_covering_spaces"/> implies there is a unique covering <m>h\colon E\rightarrow E'</m> satisfying <m>p=p'\circ h</m> and <m>h(e_0)=e_0'</m>. This justifies the <q>universal</q> in <xref ref="d_universal_covering_space"/>.

 </remark>
<p>
    It turns out that a path connected and locally path connected space <m>B</m> has a universal covering space if and only if it is <em>semilocally simply connected</em>. Connected topological manifolds provide an important example of spaces satisfying this property.

<example xml:id="eg_S1_coverings">
<title>Coverings of <m>S^1</m></title>
<p>
    The space <m>S^1</m> is semilocally simply connected, path connected, and locally path connected. What does <xref ref="th_covering_correspondence"/> say in this case?
</p>
<p>
    Let <m>P=(1,0)</m>, and identify <m>\pi_1(S^1, P)=\Z</m>. Since <m>\Z</m> is abelian, we have <m>[H]=\{H\}</m> for all subgroups <m>H\leq \Z</m>. Thus we have a bijective correspondence between subgroups of <m>\Z</m> and equivalence classes of coverings of  <m>S^1</m> by path connected and locally path connected spaces. 
</p>
<p>
    Next, for any subgroup <m>H\leq \Z</m> there is a unique nonnegative integer <m>n</m> such that <m>H=\langle n\rangle</m>. Furthermore, we have <m>\langle n\rangle \leq \langle m\rangle</m> if and only if  <m>m\mid n</m>. This means that the subgroups generated by prime integers are maximal, and the lattice of subgroups of <m>\Z</m> is ordered via divisibility. Here is a portion of this lattice corresponding to the divisors of <m>36</m>.  An arrow <m>H\rightarrow H'</m> in this diagram indicates that <m>H\leq H'</m>.

    <mrow>z \amp \mapsto z^n</mrow>
</md>
satisfies <m>(f_n)_*(\pi_1(S^1, P))\cong\angvec{n}</m>. Defining <m>f_0\colon \R\rightarrow S_1</m> to be the usual covering map <m>f_0(s)=(\cos 2\pi s, \sin 2\pi s)</m>, we see that up to equivalence, the maps <m>f_n</m> are all the coverings of <m>S^1</m>. Furthermore, the lattice of subgroups above corresponds to the following lattice  of coverings. Here an arrow between equivalence classes indicates the existence of a map of coverings.

    Not surprisingly, given coverings <m>f_n\colon S^1\rightarrow S^1</m> and  <m>f_m\colon S^1\rightarrow S^1</m> with <m>n\mid m</m>, we can pick the corresponding map of coverings
