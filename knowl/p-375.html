<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> be a Hausdorff space. A subspace <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq X\)</span> is an arc if and only if it is the image of an injective path <span class="process-math">\(\phi\colon I\rightarrow X\text{:}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is compact and <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is Hausdorff, the map <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is guaranteed to be a homeomorphism onto <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> is homeomorphic to the quotient of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> obtained by identifying its endpoints <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq X\)</span> is a simple closed curve if and only if it is the image of a path <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> that is injective on <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> and satisfies <span class="process-math">\(\phi(0)=\phi(1)\text{:}\)</span> again, since <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is compact and <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is Hausdorff, the map <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is guaranteed to be closed, hence a quotient map.</div>
