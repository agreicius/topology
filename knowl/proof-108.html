<li><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be a connected component. Since <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq\overline{C}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overline{C}\)</span> is connected, we have <span class="process-math">\(C=\overline{C}\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is connected. If <span class="process-math">\(A\cap C\ne\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A\cup C\)</span> is connected by (2) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_connected_subspace.html" title="Theorem 2.12.5: Connectedness and subspaces">TheoremÂ 2.12.5</a>. Since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is maximally connected, we have <span class="process-math">\(A\cup C=C\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq C\text{.}\)</span> A similar argument applies to path connected components.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(C_1, C_2\)</span> be connected components. By the previous result, since <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> is maximally connected, if <span class="process-math">\(C_1\cap C_2\ne \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(C_1\subseteq C_2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> is maximally connected, <span class="process-math">\(C_1=C_2\text{.}\)</span> This proves that any two distinct connected components are disjoint.</div>
<div class="para">Next given any <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be the set of all connected sets containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(\\mathcal{C}\)</span> is nonempty since <span class="process-math">\(\{x\}\in \mathcal{C}\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(C_x=\bigcup_{C\in \mathcal{C}}C\)</span> is easily seen to be a connected component containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Thus every element of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is contained in a connected component.</div>
<div class="para">Again, the argument for path connected components is very similar.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">For each <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(C_x\)</span> denote the (unique) connected component containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(P_x\)</span> denote the (unique) path connected component containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be a connected component of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>  For any <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(P_x\cap C\ne\emptyset\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(P_x\)</span> is path connected, it is connected, and hence <span class="process-math">\(P_x\subseteq C\)</span> by (1) above. It follows that <span class="process-math">\(C=\bigcup_{x\in C}P_x\)</span> is a partition of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> by path connected components.</div></li>
