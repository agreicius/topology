<span class="process-math">\((1)\iff (2) \iff (3)\text{.}\)</span> It is clear that a separation <span class="process-math">\(X=U\cup V\)</span> by open sets is the same thing as a separation as described in (2), since <span class="process-math">\(U=V^c\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V=U^c\)</span> are both open and closed. Similarly, we see that there is a separation <span class="process-math">\(X=U\cup V\)</span> if and only if and only if there is a nonempty open set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> whose complement <span class="process-math">\(U^c\)</span> is open and nonempty, if and only if there is a nontrival <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> that is open and closed.</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((2)\iff (4)\text{.}\)</span> This equivalence follows from the observation that we have <span class="process-math">\(X=A\cup B\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(A, B\)</span> as described in (4) if and only if <span class="process-math">\(A=\overline{A}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B=\overline{B}\text{,}\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are disjoint and closed.</div></article></body>
