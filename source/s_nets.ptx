    <statement>
        <p>
        Let <m>R</m> denote a binary relation on the set <m>I</m>. We write <m>iRj</m> to assert that the relation <m>R</m> holds between elements <m>i,j\in I</m>. The relation <m>R</m> is a <term>partial ordering</term> if it satisfies the following three axioms.  
        <ul>

                <title>Reflexive (PO1)</title>
                <p>
                   For all <m>i\in I</m>, we have <m>iRi</m>. 
                </p>

                <title>Transitive (PO2)</title>
                <p>
                    For all <m>i,j,k\in I</m>, if <m>iRj</m> and <m>jRk</m>, then <m>iRk</m>.

            </li>
        </ul>
        The relation <m>R</m> is a <term>quasiordering</term> (or <term>preordering</term>) if it satisfies axioms PO1 and PO2. When <m>R</m> is a partial ordering or a quasiordering, we will often write <m>i\leq j</m> for <m>iRj</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A <term>partially ordered set</term> (POSET, for short) is a pair <m>(I,\leq)</m>, where <m>\leq</m> is a partial ordering on <m>I</m>. Similarly,a <term>quasiordered set</term> is a pair <m>(I,\leq)</m>, where <m>\leq</m> is a  a quasiordering on <m>I</m>.

        A careful examination of the Riemann integral of a function over an interval <m>[a,b]</m> reveals that it is a statement about a convergent net. Indeed, let <m>I</m> be the set of all <q>pointed partitions</q> of <m>[a,b]</m> into subintervals: <ie/>, an element of <m>I</m> is a pair <m>(\mathcal{P}, \boldx)</m>, where <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is a subinterval partition

The relation <m>(\mathcal{P},\boldx)\leq (\mathcal{P}', \boldx')\iff \mathcal{P}' \text{ is a refinement of } \mathcal{P}</m> is a quasiordering on <m>I</m> satisfying (D).

The statement that the Riemann integral <m>\int_a^b f\, dx</m> exists and is equal to <m>R</m> is then equivalent to the statement that if and the net <m>(R_i)_{i\in I}</m> converges to <m>R</m>.

                        Note: the argument for the forward direction uses the axiom of choice potentially. If that bugs you, consider the following alternative: let <m>I=\{(U,y)\colon U\text{ open neighborhood of } x, y\in U\cap A\}</m> with quasiordering <m>(U,y)\leq (U', y')\iff U\supseteq U'</m>.  (This is no longer a partial ordering necessarily.) Define <m>f\colon I\rightarrow X</m> as <m>f((U,y))=y</m>. This net also converges to <m>x</m>.

                        Assume <m>f</m> is continuous and <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is a net satisfying <m>x_i\rightarrow x</m>. Given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>y</m>, the net <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is eventually in <m>f^{-1}(U)</m>, since this is an open set containing <m>x</m>. But then clearly <m>(f(x_i))_{i\in I}</m> is eventually in <m>f(f^{-1}(U))\subseteq U</m>.

                    <p>
                        Inversely, if <m>f</m> is not continuous, then there is an <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>y=f(x)</m> such that for all open sets <m>V</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an element <m>y_V=f(x_V)\in f(V)\cap (Y-U)</m>. Let <m>I</m> be the set of all open neighborhoods of <m>x</m> with partial ordering given by reverse inclusion, and consider the net <m>(x_V)_{V\in I}</m>, where <m>x_V</m> is the element described above. We have <m>x_V\rightarrow x</m>, using a similar argument as in (1), and yet <m>(f(x_V))_{V\in I}=(y_V)_{V\in I}\not\rightarrow y</m>. Indeed, by construction the net <m>(y_V)_{V\in I}</m> never lies in the open neighoborhood <m>U</m> of <m>y</m>.

Given any <m>y\ne x</m>, pick disjoint open sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. I claim that <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is not eventually in <m>V</m>.  Indeed, since <m>x_i\rightarrow x</m>, there is an <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_i\in U</m> for all <m>i\geq i_0</m>. If, similarly, there were a <m>j_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_j\in V</m> for all <m>j\geq j_0</m>, then we could find an index <m>k</m> satisfying <m>k\geq i_0</m> and <m>k\geq j_0</m>, in which case <m>x_k\in U\cap V=\emptyset</m>. Contradiction! We conclude that <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is not eventually in <m>V</m>, and hence that <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> does not converge to <m>y</m>.

Let <m>I</m> be the set of all triples <m>(U,V, z)</m>, where <m>U, V</m> are open neighborhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively, and <m>z\in U\cap V</m>. Declare <m>(U,V,z)\leq (U',V', z')</m> if and only if <m>U\supseteq U'</m> and <m>V\supseteq V'</m>. The set <m>I</m> is directed: given <m>i=(U, V, z_i), j=(U',V',z_j)\in I</m>, we can take <m>k=(U\cap U, V\cap V', z_k)</m>, for some <m>z_k\in U\cap U'\cap V\cap V'</m>. Now, let <m>f=(z_i)_{i\in I}</m> be the net in <m>X</m> defined as follows: given <m>i=(U, V,z)</m>, define <m>f(i)=z</m>. I claim that <m>z_i\rightarrow x</m> and <m>z_i\rightarrow y</m>. Indeed given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> and open set <m>V</m> containing <m>y</m>, there is an element <m>z\in U\cap V</m>. Let <m>i_0=(U,V,z)\in I</m>. For any <m>i'=(U',V', z')\geq i_0</m> we have <m>f(i')=z'\in U'\cap V'\subseteq U\cap V</m>. Thus <m>f=(z_i)_{i\in I}</m> is eventually in <m>U</m> and eventually in <m>V</m>, as desired.

        then there is a subnet of <m>f=(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> which is eventually in <m>A</m> for all <m>A\in\mathcal{A}</m>.

    <proof>
        <p>
        Assume <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is a collection of subsets of <m>X</m> satisfying conditions (i)-(ii). Define <m>J</m> to be the set of pairs <m>(i, A)</m> where <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m> and <m>x_i\in A</m>. Given <m>j=(i, A)</m>, <m>j'=(i', A')</m>, we declare <m>j\leq j'</m> if and only if <m>i\leq i'</m> and <m>A\supseteq A'</m>. It is clear that this is a quasiordering. We now show <m>J</m> is directed. Given <m>j=(i,A)</m> and <m>j'=(i', A')</m>, by property (ii) there is an <m>A''\in \mathcal{A}</m> such that <m>A''\subseteq A\cap A'</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}(A'')</m> is cofinal, there is an <m>i''\in I</m> such that <m>i''\in A''</m>, <m>i''\geq i</m> and <m>i''\geq i'</m>. Setting <m>j''=(i'', A'')</m>, we see that <m>j\leq j''</m> and <m>j'\leq j''</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Define <m>g\colon J\rightarrow I</m> as <m>g((i,A))=i</m>. It is clear that <m>g</m> is order preserving. We show that <m>g(J)</m> is cofinal in <m>I</m>. Given any <m>i\in I</m>, pick any <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> is cofinal, there is an <m>i'\geq i</m> such that <m>i'\in f^{-1}(A)</m>. We have <m>i'=g((i', A))</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, we show that the subnet <m>(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m> is eventually in <m>A</m> for all <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>. Indeed, given <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>, let <m>j_0=(i, A)</m> for any <m>i\in f^{-1}(A)</m>. If <m>j\geq j_0</m> for <m>j=(i', A')</m>, then we have <m>i\leq i'</m> and <m>A'\subseteq A</m>. It follows that <m>x_{g(j)}=i'\in A'\subseteq A</m>. This proves <m>x_{g(j)}\in A</m> for all <m>j\geq j_0</m>, and thus that <m>(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m> is eventually in <m>A</m>.
