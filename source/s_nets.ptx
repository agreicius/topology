    <title>Nets</title>
    <p>
        Nets are a relatively straightforward generalization of a sequence <m>(x_n)_{n\in \Z_+}</m> obtained by replacing the index set <m>\Z_+</m> with the more general notion of a <em>directed set</em>. Our main application of the theory of nets is (a) to give a characterization of compactness in terms of convergence and limit points of nets (<xref ref="th_nets_compactness" text="global"/>), and (b) to use this characterization to prove the <xref ref="th_Tychonoff_general" text="custom">Tychonoff theorem </xref>

        A careful examination of the Riemann integral of a function over an interval <m>[a,b]</m> reveals that it is a statement about a convergent net. Indeed, let <m>I</m> be the set of all <q>pointed partitions</q> of <m>[a,b]</m> into subintervals: <ie/>, an element of <m>I</m> is a pair <m>(\mathcal{P}, \boldx)</m>, where <m>\mathcal{P}</m> is a subinterval partition

The statement that the Riemann integral <m>\int_a^b f\, dx</m> exists and is equal to <m>R</m> is then equivalent to the statement that the net <m>(R_i)_{i\in I}</m> converges to <m>R</m>.

                        First we show the forward implication. Assume <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>. Let <m>I</m> be the set of all pairs <m>i=(U,a)</m>, where <m>U</m> is an open neighborhoods of <m>x</m>, and <m>a\in U\cap A</m>. The set <m>I</m> is nonempty since <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>.

It is easy to see that <m>I</m> is a quasi-ordered and directed set with respect to this relation. Lastly, define <m>f\colon I\rightarrow A</m> as <m>f((U,a))=a</m>. The net <m>f</m> converges to <m>x</m>. Indeed, for any open set <m>V</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an element <m>a\in V\cap A</m>. Setting <m>i_0=(V,a)</m>, if <m>j=(U,a')</m> satisfies <m>j\geq i_0</m>, then <m>U\subseteq V</m> and hence <m>f(j)=f((U,a'))=a'\in V</m>, as desired.

                    <p>
                        For the reverse implication, assume <m>x_i\rightarrow x</m> for some net <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> in <m>A</m>. Given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_j\in U</m> for all <m>j\geq i_0</m>. In particular, we have <m>x_{i_0}\in U</m>.

Given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>y</m>, the net <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is eventually in <m>f^{-1}(U)</m>, since this is an open set containing <m>x</m>.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, the net <m>f\circ h</m>, defined as <m>f\circ h((V,z))=f(z)</m> does not converge to <m>f(x)</m>. Indeed by construction, for <em>all</em> <m>j=(V,z)\in J</m> we have <m>f(z)\notin U</m>.

Given any <m>y\ne x</m>, pick disjoint open sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. I claim that <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is not eventually in <m>V</m>.  Indeed, since <m>x_i\rightarrow x</m>, there is an <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_i\in U</m> for all <m>i\geq i_0</m>. If, similarly, there were a <m>j_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_j\in V</m> for all <m>j\geq j_0</m>, then we could find an index <m>k</m> satisfying <m>k\geq i_0</m> and <m>k\geq j_0</m>, in which case <m>x_k\in U\cap V=\emptyset</m>.

                        Now assume that <m>X</m> is not Hausdorff, as witnessed by elements <m>x\ne y\in X</m>: this means for all open sets <m>U, V</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively, we have have <m>U\cap V\ne \emptyset</m>. Let <m>I</m> be the set of all triples <m>(U,V, z)</m>, where <m>U, V</m> are open neighborhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively, and <m>z\in U\cap V</m>.

Now, let <m>f=(z_i)_{i\in I}</m> be the net in <m>X</m> defined as follows: given <m>i=(U, V,z)</m>, define <m>f(i)=z</m>. I claim that <m>z_i\rightarrow x</m> and <m>z_i\rightarrow y</m>. Indeed given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> and open set <m>V</m> containing <m>y</m>, there is an element <m>z\in U\cap V</m>. Let <m>i_0=(U,V,z)\in I</m>. For any <m>i'=(U',V', z')\geq i_0</m> we have <m>f(i')=z'\in U'\cap V'\subseteq U\cap V</m>. Thus <m>f=(z_i)_{i\in I}</m> is eventually in <m>U</m> and eventually in <m>V</m>, as desired.

Let <m>U</m> be an open neighborhood of <m>x</m> such that <m>I_U=\{i\in I\colon x_i\in U\}</m> is not cofinal; then there exists an <m>i_0\in I</m> such that <m>x_i\notin U</m>for all <m>i\in I_U</m> with <m>i\geq i_0</m>. Let <m>h=f\circ g\colon J\rightarrow X</m> be a subnet of <m>f</m>. We can write <m>h=(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m>. I claim that <m>x_{g(j)}\not\to x</m>. Indeed, since <m>g(J)</m> is cofinal in <m>I</m> we can find a <m>j_0</m> such that <m>g(j_0)\geq i_0</m>, in which case for all all <m>j\geq j_0</m> we have <m>g(j)\geq g(j_0)\geq i_0</m>, and thus <m>x_{g(j)}\notin U</m>. This shows that in fact <m>(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m> is eventually in <m>X-U</m>; in particular it is definitely not eventually in <m>U</m>.

        then there is a subnet of <m>f=(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> which is eventually in <m>A</m> for all <m>A\in\mathcal{A}</m>.

    <proof>
        <p>
        Assume <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is a collection of subsets of <m>X</m> satisfying conditions (i)-(ii). Define <m>J</m> to be the set of pairs <m>(i, A)</m> where <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m> and <m>x_i\in A</m>. Given <m>j=(i, A)</m>, <m>j'=(i', A')</m>, we declare <m>j\leq j'</m> if and only if <m>i\leq i'</m> and <m>A\supseteq A'</m>. It is clear that this is a quasiordering. We now show <m>J</m> is directed. Given <m>j=(i,A)</m> and <m>j'=(i', A')</m>, by property (ii) there is an <m>A''\in \mathcal{A}</m> such that <m>A''\subseteq A\cap A'</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}(A'')</m> is cofinal, there is an <m>i''\in I</m> such that <m>i''\in A''</m>, <m>i''\geq i</m> and <m>i''\geq i'</m>. Setting <m>j''=(i'', A'')</m>, we see that <m>j\leq j''</m> and <m>j'\leq j''</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Define <m>g\colon J\rightarrow I</m> as <m>g((i,A))=i</m>. It is clear that <m>g</m> is order preserving. We show that <m>g(J)</m> is cofinal in <m>I</m>. Given any <m>i\in I</m>, pick any <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> is cofinal, there is an <m>i'\geq i</m> such that <m>i'\in f^{-1}(A)</m>. We have <m>i'=g((i', A))</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, we show that the subnet <m>(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m> is eventually in <m>A</m> for all <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>. Indeed, given <m>A\in \mathcal{A}</m>, let <m>j_0=(i, A)</m> for any <m>i\in f^{-1}(A)</m>. If <m>j\geq j_0</m> for <m>j=(i', A')</m>, then we have <m>i\leq i'</m> and <m>A'\subseteq A</m>. It follows that <m>x_{g(j)}=i'\in A'\subseteq A</m>. This proves <m>x_{g(j)}\in A</m> for all <m>j\geq j_0</m>, and thus that <m>(x_{g(j)})_{j\in J}</m> is eventually in <m>A</m>.

    </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            Statements (ii) and (iii) are immediately seen to be equivalent thanks to <xref ref="th_nets_limit_points"/>. We will show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent.

            <p>
                Let <m>f=(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> be a net in <m>X</m>. For each <m>i\in I</m> define <m>C_i=\overline{\{x_j\colon j\geq i\}}</m>. Clearly each <m>C_i</m> is closed and nonempty. Furthermore, for any finite collection <m>i_1,i_2,\dots, i_n</m> we have <m>\bigcap_{k=1}^n C_{i_k}\ne \emptyset</m>, since we can find a <m>j</m> such that <m>j\geq i_k</m> for all <m>1\leq k\leq n</m>, and hence <m>x_j\in \bigcap_{k=1}^n C_{i_k}</m>. Since <m>X</m> is assumed to be compact, there is an element <m>x\in \bigcap_{i\in I}C_i</m>. We show that <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m>. Indeed, given any open set <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m> and any <m>i\in I</m>, since <m>x\in C_i=\overline{\{x_j\colon j\geq i\}}</m>, there is an element <m>x_j</m> with <m>j\geq i</m> such that <m>x_j\in U</m>. This proves that <m>(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> is cofinally in <m>U</m>, as desired.

        <case>
            <title>Implication: (ii) <m>\implies</m> (i)</title>
            <p>
                We prove the contrapositive. Suppose <m>X</m> is not compact, and let <m>\mathcal{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a cover with no finite cover. Define <m>J</m> to the be the set of all pairs <m>(K, x)</m>, where <m>K</m> is a finite subset of <m>I</m> and <m>x\in X-\bigcup_{k\in K}U_k</m>. (Note that <m>X-\bigcup_{k\in K}U_k\ne\emptyset</m> since <m>\mathcal{U}</m> has no finite subcover.) It is easy to see that <m>J</m> is a directed set under the quasiordering defined as <m>(K, x)\leq (K', x')</m> if and only if <m>K\subseteq K'</m>. Define the net <m>f\colon J\rightarrow X</m> as <m>f((K, x))=x</m>.  We show that <m>f</m> has no limit point. To this end, given any <m>y\in Y</m>, we have <m>y\in U_{i_0}</m> for some <m>i_0\in I </m>. We will show that the net <m>f</m> is not cofinally in <m>U_{i_0}</m>. To this end consider the index <m>j=({i_0}, x)\in J</m>, where <m>x\in X-U_{i_0}</m>. For all <m>j'=(K, x)</m> with <m>j'\geq j</m>, we have <m>K\supseteq \{i_0\}</m>, in which case <m>f(j')=x\in X-\bigcup_{k\in K}U_k\subseteq X-U_{i_0}</m>. Thus there is no <m>j'\geq j</m> satisfying <m>f(j)\in U_{i_0}</m>.
