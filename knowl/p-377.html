<div class="para">The goal of the next two lectures is to prove the <em class="emphasis">Jordan curve theorem</em>: any simple closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq \R^2\)</span> separates <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> into two components. That this statement is true seems intuitively clear, painfully obvious even: like the circle, any simple closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> should have a well-defined “inside” and “outside”, giving us exactly two components of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2-C\text{.}\)</span> All the more maddening, then, that a proof of this fact turns out to be rather difficult. On the other hand, the seemingly well-behaved notion of a path has surprised us with some pathological behavior on other occasions: forget not the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/top_eg_space_filling.html" title="Topological specimen 18: Space-filling curve">space filling curve</a>! First we include a useful result (not officially covered last quarter) about <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/d_locally_connected.html" title="Definition 2.14.3: Locally connected space">locally connected spaces</a>.</div>
