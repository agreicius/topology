<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be a limit point of the net <span class="process-math">\((x_i)_{i\in I}\text{.}\)</span> By definition of limit point, the collection <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> of all open neighborhoods of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies condition (i) of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem_Kelleys_lemma.html" title="Lemma 2.24.10: Kelley's lemma">Kelley's lemma</a>; condition (ii) follows from properties of open sets. We conclude that there is a subnet which is eventually in <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> for all open sets containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and thus that this subnet converges to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
