  <title>Compactness in <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    Before investigating the notion of compactness in the setting of <m>\R^n</m>, we first drop a real whopper of a theorem. Tychonoff's theorem states simply that arbitrary products of compact topological spaces are compact with respect to the product topology. The proof of this most general result requires the axiom of choice; in fact, as we will show, it is <em>equivalent</em> to the axiom of choice. We will provide a full proof of Tychonoff's theorem later using the concept of <em>nets</em>. In the meantime, we will officially state the result, make use of the result in all its generality henceforth, and provide a proof for the case where we have a finite product.   
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="th_Tychonoff">
    <title>Tychonoff theorem</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
        Given any collection <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> of compact topological spaces, the product space <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m> is compact with respect to the product topology. 
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            For now we only prove the result for finite products. 
            <!-- (See <xref ref="th_Tychonoff_general"/> for the general case.)  -->
            It suffices, by induction, to show that the product of two compact spaces is compact, and for this case we will use <xref ref="lem_tube"/>, which is quite useful in its own right. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be compact topological spaces, and suppose we have an open covering <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in}</m> of  <m>X\times Y</m>. For any <m>x\in X</m> the subspace <m>\{x\}\times Y</m> is homeomorphic to <m>Y</m> and hence compact. Since <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a covering of <m>\{x\}\times Y</m>, there is a finite set <m>J_x\subseteq I</m> such that 
          <me>
            \{x\}\times Y\subseteq \bigcup_{j\in J_x}U_j
          </me>.
          Since <m>Y</m> is compact, it follows by the tube lemma that there is an open set <m>U_x\subseteq X</m> such that 
          <me>
            U_x\times Y\subseteq \bigcup_{j\in J_x}U_j
          </me>.
          Since <m>X=\bigcup_{x\in X}U_x</m> and <m>X</m> is compact, there are elements <m>\{x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n\}</m> such that 
          <men xml:id="eq_Tych_baby">
            X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_{x_i}
          </men>.
          We claim that 
          <me>
            X\times Y=\bigcup_{i=1}^n \left (\bigcup_{j\in J_{x_i}} U_j \right)
          </me>,
          in which case <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in \bigcup_{i=1}^n J_{x_i}}</m> is a finite subcovering of <m>X\times Y</m>, as desired. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's see why <xref ref="eq_Tych_baby"/> holds: given any <m>(x,y)\in X\times Y</m>, we have <m>x\in U_{x_i}</m> for some <m>i</m>, in which case 
          <me>
            (x,y)\in U_i\times Y\subseteq \bigcup_{j\in J_{x_i}}U_j\subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^n \left (\bigcup_{j\in J_{x_i}} U_j \right),
          </me>
          as desired. The reverse inclusion is automatic.

    <title>Tube lemma</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
           Let <m>X, Y</m> be topological spaces, and assume <m>Y</m> is compact. Given any <m>x_0\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>\{x\}\times Y</m>, there is an open set <m>W\subseteq X</m> such that 
           <m>\{x\}\times Y\subseteq W\times Y\subseteq U</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>U</m> is an open set satisfying <m>\{x\}\times Y\subseteq U</m>, then for all <m>y\in Y</m>, there exists open sets <m>U_{y}\subseteq X</m> and <m>V_y\subseteq Y</m>  such that <m>x\in U_y</m> and <m>y\in V_y</m> and <m>U_y\times V_y\subseteq U</m>. Since <m>\{V_y\}_{y\in Y}</m> is an open covering of <m>Y</m> and <m>Y</m> is compact, we have 
        <me>
          Y=\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_{y_i}
        </me>
        for some elements <m>y_1,y_2,\dots, y_n</m>. Let <m>W=\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_{y_i}</m>. Clearly we have <m>\{x\}\times Y\subseteq W\times Y</m>. Furthermore, given any <m>(x,y)\in W</m> we have <m>y\in V_{y_i}</m> for some <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>. Since <m>x\in W\subseteq U_{y_i}</m>, we conclude that 
        <me>
          (x,y)\in U_{y_i}\times V_{y_i}\subseteq U
        </me>.
        This proves <m>W\times Y\subseteq U</m>, as desired.

        The box is compact by the (finite version) of Tychonoff's theorem, since any closed interval is compact.

        The closed ball <m>\overline{B}_\epsilon(\boldx_0)</m> is homeomorphic to <m>\overline{B}_\epsilon(\boldzero)</m>, which in turn is homeomorphic to the box <m>B=[-\epsilon, \epsilon]^n</m> via the map

      <p>
        It is clear that the empty set is compact, closed, and bounded. Henceforth, we assume <m>A</m> is nonempty. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Assume <m>A</m> is compact. Since <m>\R^n</m> is Hausdorff, we know from <xref ref="th_compact_Haus_closed"/> that <m>A</m> is closed. We now show that <m>A</m> is bounded. Pick any <m>\boldx\in A</m>. We have <m>A\subseteq \bigcup_{n\in \Z_+}B_n(\boldx)</m>. Since <m>A</m> is compact, we have <m>A\subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^N B_n(\boldx)=B_{N}(\boldx)</m> for some <m>N</m>. It follows that <m>d(\boldy,\boldy')\leq 2N</m> for all <m>\boldy, \boldy'\in A</m>, in which case <m>\operatorname{diam}(A)\leq 2N&lt; \infty</m>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume <m>A</m> is closed. If furthermore <m>\operatorname{diam}A=N &lt; \infty</m>, then <m>A</m> is a closed subset
