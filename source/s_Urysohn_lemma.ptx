        <statement>
            <p>
            Let <m>X</m> be a normal space. Given two nonempty disjoint closed sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> such that <m>f(A)=\{0\}</m> and <m>f(B)=\{1\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It follows easily that the result is still true if we replace the interval <m>[0,1]</m> with any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                It would be difficult to improve upon Munkres' exposition of this. I give essentially a full proof below nonetheless.
            </p>
            <proof>
                <title>Step 1: construction of open sets <m>U_p</m></title>
                    <p>
                      The first crucial step in the proof is to build a collection of open sets <m>\{U_p\}_{p\in \Q}</m> satisfying <m>\overline{U_p}\subseteq U_{q}</m> if <m>p&lt; q</m>. This is done by first 
                      picking an enumeration of <m>\Q\cap [0,1]=\{p_1,p_2,\dots,\}</m> where for convenience <m>p_1=1</m> and <m>p_2=0</m>. We use the enumeration to define open sets <m>U_p</m> for each <m>p\in \Q</m> recursively as follows. Set <m>U_1=X-B</m>. Since <m>A\subseteq U_1</m>, by <xref ref="th_regular_normal_equivalence"/> we can find an open <m>U_0</m> containing <m>A</m> such that <m>\overline{U}_0\subseteq U_1</m>. Now take any <m>n\geq 2</m> and assume by induction that we constructed open sets <m>U_{p_1}, U_{p_2},\dots, U_{p_n}</m> satisfying the desired inclusion condition. Write <m>p&lt; p_{n+1} &lt; q</m> where  <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are the immediate predecessor and successor, respectively, of <m>p_{n+1}</m> among the set <m>\{p_1,p_2,\dots, p_n\}</m>. By induction we have <m>\overline{U_p}\subseteq U_q</m>. Pick <m>U_{p_{n+1}}</m> to be any open set satisfying 
                      <me>
                        \overline{U_p}\subseteq U_{p_{n+1}}\subseteq \overline{U_{p_{n+1}}}\subseteq U_q
                      </me>.
                      Lastly define <m>U_p=\emptyset</m> for all <m>p&lt; 0</m> and <m>U_p=X</m> for all <m>p&gt; 0</m>. It is easy to see that thus defined, our collection <m>\{U_p\}_{p\in \Q}</m> satisfies the desired inclusion condition. 
                    </p>
                </proof>
                <proof>
                    <title>Step 2: definition of <m>f</m> and continuity</title>
                    <p>
                    Define <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R</m> as 
                    <me>
                        f(x)=\inf\{p\in \Q\colon x\in U_p\}
                    </me>.
                    Some easy properties of <m>f</m>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>0\leq f(x)\leq 1</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>f(x)\leq p</m> for all <m>x\in \overline{U_p}</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>f(x)\geq p</m> for all <m>x\notin U_p</m>. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    We prove continuity by showing that <m>f</m> is continuous at each <m>x</m>. Given <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>y=f(x)</m>, choose rational numbers <m>p, q</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        a&lt; p&lt; y &lt; q &lt; b
                    </me>.
                    I claim <m>U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        f(U_q-\overline{U_p})\subseteq [p,q]\subseteq (a,b)
                    </me>. 
                    First, it is clear that <m>U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is open, and it follows easily from the elementary properties of <m>f</m> quoted above that <m>x\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>. Next, given any <m>x'\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>, since <m>x'\in \overline{U_q}</m>, we have <m>f(x')\leq q</m>, and since <m>x'\notin U_p</m>, we have <m>f(x')\geq p</m>. This concludes the proof.

            If the closed sets <m>A, B</m> are separated by the continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m>, they are separated by the open sets <m>U=f^{-1}[0,1/2)</m> and <m>V=f^{-1}(1/2, 1]</m>. The Urysohn lemma tells us that in normal spaces the two notions are equivalent!

        We can explore this idea of <q>separated by a continuous function</q> in relation to some of the other <foreign>Trennnungsaxiome</foreign>. For example, taking the regularity axiom (<m>T_3</m>) and replacing the separated by open sets condition with a separated by a continuous function condition, we obtain the notion of <em>complete regularity</em>.

        <p>
         With respect to regularity, separation by a continuous function is truly a stronger notion: <ie/>, there are spaces that are regular but not completely regular. This is in contrast to the situation with normality: by Urysohn's lemma a space is normal if and only if disjoint closed sets are separated by a continuous function. Note also that by Urysohn's lemma, any normal space is completely regular. Thus adding <m>T_{3\frac{1}{2}}</m> to our list of <foreign>Trennungsaxiome</foreign> we still have a list of properties that satisfies <m>T_n\implies T_m</m> if <m>n\geq m</m>.

        The notion of complete regularity strikes a nice balance between regularity and normality. In particular, it is stronger than regularity, but still behaves well with respect to subspaces and products.

                The proof of (1) is elementary. (See text.) The proof of (2) is more interesting. Assume <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a collection of completely regular spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>. Let <m>A\subseteq X</m> be a closed set, and let <m>b=(b_i)_{i\in I}</m> be any element not contained in <m>A</m>. Since <m>X-A</m> is open, we can find a base open neighborhood of <m>b</m> of the form <m>U=\prod_{k=1}^n U_{i_k}\times \prod_{i\ne i_k}X_i</m>. For each <m>1\leq k\leq n</m> let <m>f_k\colon X_{i_k}\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a continuous function satisfying <m>f_k(b_{i_k})=1, f_k(U_{i_k}^c)=\{0\}</m>.  The function
