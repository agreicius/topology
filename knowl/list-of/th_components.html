<div class="para">Let us prove that <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is maximally connected. It is connected as it is the union of connected sets containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\subseteq A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is connected, then since <span class="process-math">\(x\in A\text{,}\)</span> we have by definition <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq C(x)\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is maximally connected. Lastly, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a maximally connected set containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then by definition we have <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq C(x)\text{;}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is maximally connected we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(A=C(x)\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is the <em class="emphasis">unique</em> maximally connected set containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">The proof that <span class="process-math">\(C_p(x)\)</span> is the unique maximally path-connected set containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> proceeds in exactly the same manner. We use the fact (not made official, but easy to show) that a union of path-path connected sets with a common intersection point is path connected.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">It is clear that <span class="process-math">\(X=\bigcup_{x\in X}C(x)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(x\in C(x)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, we know <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is maximally connected by <span class="process-math">\((1)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\overline{C(x)}\)</span> is connected and <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\subseteq \overline{C(x)}\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(C(x)=\overline{C(x)}\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is closed.</div>
<div class="para">Lastly, to see that the components <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> are disjoint, we will show that <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\cap C(y)\ne \emptyset\implies C(x)=C(y)\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\cap C(y)\ne \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\cup C(y)\)</span> is a connected set containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is maximally connected, we must have <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\cup C(y)=C(x)\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(C(y)\subseteq C(x)\text{.}\)</span> The same argument shows <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\subseteq C(y)\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(C(x)=C(y)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">The proof here is exactly as with connected components. Again, we use the fact that the union of path-connected sets sharing a common point is path connected.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is connected. If <span class="process-math">\(A\cap C\ne\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(A\cup C\)</span> is connected by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/th_connected_subspace.html" title="Theorem 1.12.6: Connectedness and subspaces">TheoremÂ 1.12.6</a>. Since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is maximally connected, we have <span class="process-math">\(A\cup C=C\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(A\subseteq C\text{.}\)</span> A similar argument applies to path-connected components.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(C_p(x)\)</span> is connected and <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> is the union of all connected sets containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(C_p(x)\subseteq C(x)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(C(x)=C(y)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(y\in C(x)\text{,}\)</span> we further have <span class="process-math">\(C_p(y)\subseteq C(x)\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(y\in C(x)\text{.}\)</span> It follows easily that <span class="process-math">\(C(x)=\bigcup_{y\in C(x)}C_p(y)\text{.}\)</span> That this union is disjoint follows from (3).</div></li>
