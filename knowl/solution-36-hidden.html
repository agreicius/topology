<div class="para">As observed in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/top_eg_arbitrary_product.html" title="Topological specimen 10: Product space (arbitrary)">Topological specimenÂ 10</a>, the product topology is always contained in the box topology. Let's see whether the inclusion is strict in either case.</div> <ol class="decimal">

<div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> has the discrete topology. Since <span class="process-math">\(\{1\}\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{,}\)</span> the set</div>

<div class="para">for some <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(V_{i}\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\in V\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\{1\}\subseteq V_i\ne\emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(V_i=\{0,1\}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\geq N\text{,}\)</span> the element <span class="process-math">\((1,1,\dots, 1,0,0,\dots)\in V\text{,}\)</span> from which it follows that <span class="process-math">\(V\not\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is not a union of basis elements of the product topology, and hence is not open in the product topology.</div>

<div class="para">It is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}^\Z\)</span> is discrete in the box topology. The argument above shows that <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}^\Z\)</span> is not discrete in the product topology, since the singleton <span class="process-math">\(\{(1,1,\dots, 1)\}\)</span> is not open.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Now equip <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> with the trivial topology. Since the only open subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> it follows that a basis element <span class="process-math">\(B=\prod_{i=1}^\infty U_i\)</span> in either topology is either empty (if <span class="process-math">\(U_i=\emptyset\)</span> for <em class="emphasis">any</em> <span class="process-math">\(i\in I\)</span>) or equal to <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> (if <span class="process-math">\(U_i=\{0,1\}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\in I\)</span>). Since the bases of the two topologies are equal, the topologies are equal. Furthermore, since the only basis elements are <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> the topology on <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is just the trivial one: i.e., we have <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{prod}}=\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{box}}=\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{trivial}}\text{.}\)</span>
