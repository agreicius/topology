  <title>Convergence in product spaces</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The relative virtues of the product and box topologies begin to come to light as we look at issues of convergence and metrics in product spaces. In particular, we see in the context of the spaces <m>\R^\omega</m> and <m>\R^\R</m> that different topologies on these product sets give rise to different and valuable notions of function convergence for real-valued functions.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topological spaces, let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>, and let <m>(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a sequence of elements of <m>X</m>: <ie />, using tuple notation, for each <m>n\in \Z_+</m> we have

      Observe that the definition of pointwise convergence makes no reference to any topology on <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>. Below we investigate how it relates to convergence in the box and product topologies.

<example>
  <title>Sequences in <m>\R^\omega</m> and <m>\R^\R</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Our understanding of tuples in product spaces as functions pays real dividends when investigating convergence of sequences in these spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if a tuple <m>(x_i)_{i=1}^\infty</m> in <m>\R^\omega</m> is just a function <m>f=\Z_+\rightarrow \R</m>, the graph of which in the real plane is easily visualized: namely, a discrete collection of plotted points <m>(n, f(n))</m> for <m>n\in \{1,2,3,\dots\}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, a tuple <m>(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in \R}</m> in <m>\R^\R</m> is just a function <m>f\colon \R\rightarrow\R</m>, which is easily visualized via a graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, sequences of tuples are easily visualized as sequences of functions <m>(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> (via their graphs). Furthermore, for the sequence to converge pointwise pointwise at a given index <m>i</m> (<m>n\in \Z_+</m> for <m>\R^\omega</m>, and <m>r\in \R</m> for <m>\R^\R</m>) is simply for the sequence of values <m>(f_n(i))_{n=1}^\infty</m> to converge.
    </p>
  </statement>

<theorem xml:id="th_pointwise_convergence">
  <title>Pointwise convergence and product topology</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topologies, let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m> be their product, and let <m>(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a sequence of elements of <m>X</m>.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>f_n\rightarrow f</m> in the box or product topology, then <m>f_n</m> converges to <m>f</m> pointwise.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In the product topology we have
        <me>
          f_n\to f \iff f_n \text{ converges to } f \text{ pointwise}
        </me>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>f_n\rightarrow f</m> in either topology. Fix <m>i\in I</m> and let <m>U_i\ni f(i)</m> be any open set containing <m>f(i)\in X_i</m>. The set <m>U=U_i\times \prod_{j\ne i}U_j</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>f</m> in both topologies. By convergence there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>f_n\in U</m> for all <m>n\geq N</m>. It follows that <m>f_n(i)\in U_i</m> for all <m>n\geq N</m>. This proves that <m>f_n(i)\rightarrow f(i)</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> pointwise. To show <m>f_n\rightarrow f</m> in the product topology it is enough to show that for any base open set of the form
            <m>U_{i_1}\times U_{i_2}\times\cdots \times U_{i_m}\times \prod_{k\ne i_k }X_k</m> there is an <m>N</m> such that if <m>n\geq N</m>, then <m>f_n\in U</m>. Since <m>(f_n)</m> converges to <m>f</m> pointwise, for each <m>i_j</m>, <m>1\leq j\leq m</m> there is an <m>N_{i_j}</m> such that if <m>n\geq N_{i_j}</m>,
            then <m>f_n(i_j)\in U_{i_j}</m>. Setting <m>N=\max\{ N_{i_j}\}_{j=1}^m</m>, it follows that if <m>n\geq N</m> then <m>f_n(i_j)\in U_{i_j}</m> for <m>1\leq j\leq m</m>. Since <m>f_n(j)\in X_j</m> for all <m>j\ne i_j</m> we conclude that <m>f_n\in U</m> for all <m>n\geq N</m>, as desired.

  <solution>
    <p>
      It is relatively easy to see that the sequence <m>f_n</m> converges pointwise to <m>f=(0,0,\dots)</m>. Since <m>\R</m> with the standard topology is Hausdorff, it follows that this pointwise limit is unique. By <xref ref="th_pointwise_convergence"/>, <m>(f_n)</m> also converges in the product topology to <m>f</m>. We claim <m>(f_n)</m> does not converge at all in the box topology. First observe, that the only candidate for the limit of this convergence is <m>f=(0,0,\dots,)</m>, using (1) of <xref ref="th_pointwise_convergence"/>. Now consider the open set
      <me>
        U=(-1,1)\times (-1/2, 1/2)\times (-1/3,1/3)\times\cdots=\prod_{n=1}^\infty(-1/n, 1/n)
      </me>.
      We have <m>f=(0,0,\dots, )\in U</m>, and yet not only is it not the case that the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> eventually lies in <m>U</m>, in fact we have <m>f_n\notin U</m> for all <m>n\in \Z_+</m>.

      <me>
        \mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{prod}}\subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{uni}}\subseteq  \mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{box}}
      </me>.
      When <m>I</m> is infinite these inclusions are all strict.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Take any open set <m>U</m> in the product topology and any <m>x=(x_i)_{i\in I}</m> lying in <m>U</m>. There is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m> lying in <m>U</m> of the form  <m>B=\prod_{j=1}^n (x_{i_j}-\epsilon_{i_j},x_{i_j}+\epsilon_{i_j})\times \prod_{i\ne i_j}\R</m>, where we may further assume <m>\epsilon_{i_j}&lt; 1</m> for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. Letting  <m>\epsilon=\min\{\epsilon_{i_j}\}</m>, I claim
      we have <m>B_\epsilon(x)\subseteq B</m>. Indeed, for any <m>y\in B_{\epsilon}(x)</m>, we have
      <md>
        <mrow>\sup\{\overline{d}(y_i,x_i)\} &lt; \epsilon \amp \implies \min\{\abs{y_{i_j}-x_{i_j}},1\}&lt;  \epsilon \text{ for all } 1\leq j\leq n </mrow>
        <mrow>  \amp \implies \abs{y_{i_j}-x_{i_j}}&lt;  \epsilon \text{ for all } 1\leq j\leq n \amp (\epsilon &lt; 1)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp\implies \abs{y_{i_j}-x_{i_j}}&lt; \epsilon_{i_j} \text{ for all } 1\leq j\leq n </mrow>
        <mrow>  \amp \implies y\in B</mrow>
      </md>
       This proves that <m>\mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{prod}}\subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\operatorname{uni}}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next inclusion, take any open set <m>U</m> in the uniform topology. For any <m>x\in U</m> we can find <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m> such that <m>B_{\epsilon}(x)\subseteq U</m>. Let <m>V=\prod_{i\in I}(x_i-\epsilon/2, x_i+\epsilon/2)</m>, which is open in the box topology. Given any <m>y=(y_i)\in V</m>, we have <m>\overline{d}(y_i, x_i)\leq \abs{y_i-x_i}&lt; \epsilon/2</m>. It follows that in the uniform metric we have
      <me>
        d_{\operatorname{uni}}(y,x)=\sup\{\overline{d}(y_i, x_i)\}\leq \epsilon/2&lt; \epsilon

      The fact that both inclusions are strict when <m>I</m> is infinite is left as a homework exercise.

In particular, the product topology on <m>\R^\R</m> is not a metric topology. The product topology on <m>\R^\R</m> is valuable to us, since it is the natural setting to study pointwise convergence of functions (<xref ref="th_pointwise_convergence" text='global'/>).
