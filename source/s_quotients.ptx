    Let <m>(X,\mathcal{T})</m> be a topological space, let <m>Y</m> be a set (not necessarily a topological space), and let <m>q\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a surjective function. The collection
    <me>
      \mathcal{T}'=\{U\subset Y\colon q^{-1}(U)\in \mathcal{T}\}=\{U\subset Y\colon q^{-1}(U) \text{ open in } X\}
    </me>
    is a topology on <m>Y</m> called the <term>quotient topology</term> on <m>Y</m> with respect to <m>q</m>, and we call <m>Y</m> a <term>quotient</term> of the space <m>X</m>. Furthermore the map <m>q</m> is continuous with respect to <m>\mathcal{T}'</m>. 
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assuming <m>\mathcal{T}'</m> is a topology, it is easy to see that <m>q</m> is continuous with respect to it. Indeed, by definition <m>q^{-1}(U)\in \mathcal{T}</m> if and only if <m>U\in \mathcal{T}'</m>. (In fact, <m>q</m> satsifies the stonger property of being a <em>quotient map</em>. See <xref ref="d_quotient_map"/>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's show that <m>\mathcal{T}'</m> is indeed a topology on <m>Y</m>. 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>q^{-1}(\emptyset)=\emptyset\in \mathcal{T}</m> and <m>q^{-1}(Y)=X\in \mathcal{T}</m>, we see that <m>\emptyset\in \mathcal{T}'</m> and <m>Y\in \mathcal{T}'</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume <m>\{U_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a collection of elements of <m>\mathcal{T}'</m>. By definition, this means that <m>q^{-1}(U_i)</m> is open in <m>X</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. Since 
            <md>
              <mrow>q^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\right) \amp = \bigcup_{i\in I} q^{-1}(U_i)</mrow>
            </md>
            we see that <m>q^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\right)</m> is open in <m>X</m>, being a union of open sets. It follows by definition that <m> \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i\in \mathcal{T}'</m> , as desired. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have 
            <md>
              <mrow>U_1,U_2\in \mathcal{T}' \amp \iff q^{-1}(U_1), q^{-1}(U_2)\in \mathcal{T} </mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \implies q^{-1}(U_1)\cap q^{-1}(U_2)\in \mathcal{T}'</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \implies q^{-1}(U_1\cap U_2)\in \mathcal{T}' \amp (q^{-1}(U_1\cap U_2)=q^{-1}(U_1)\cap q^{-1}(U_2))</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp \iff U_1\cap U_2\in \mathcal{T}'</mrow>

  <title>Quotient by an equivalence relation</title>
  <p>
    <em>Up to homeomorphism</em>, a quotient space as defined in <xref ref="top_eg_quotient_space"/> is the same thing as a quotient by an equivalence relation. In more detail, given a topological space <m>X</m> and surjective function <m>q\colon X\rightarrow Y</m>, we can define a equivalence relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> as 
    <me>
      x\sim x' \iff q(x)=q(x')
    </me>,
    and it easy to show (at least, once we can make use of some of the theoretical tools developed below) that <m>X/\sim</m> is homeomorphic to <m>Y</m> with its quotient topology.  See <xref ref="eg_quot_equiv"/>.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>\sim</m> be the equivalence relation described. For any <m>x\in [0,1]</m>, its equivalence class <m>[x]_\sim</m> is either <m>\{x\}</m>, if <m>x\notin \{0,1\}</m>, or <m>\{0,1\}</m>, if <m>x\in \{0,1\}</m>. 
            We imagine making the identification of <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> as taking a line segment and connecting the two endpoints. Since that object is loop-like, we guess that the quotient <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to the circle <m>S^1=\{(x,y)\in \R^2\colon x^2+y^2=1\}</m>. 
          </p>

            <me>
              [x]_\sim=\{x+n\colon n\in \Z\}
            </me>.
            It is easy to see that every <m>x\in \R</m> is equivalent to an element <m>x'\in [0,1]</m>, so that under this identification <m>\R</m> is first <q>collapsed</q> to the interval <m>[0,1]</m>. Since furthermore <m>0\sim 1</m>, we guess that <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to the quotient space in (a), and hence also to <m>S^1</m>

          <p>
            For <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times [0,1]</m>, its equivalence class <m>[(x,y)]_\sim</m> is either <m>\{(x,y)\}</m>, if <m>x\notin \{0,1\}</m>, and <m>\{(0,y), (1,y)\}</m> if <m>x\in \{0,1\}</m>. Geometrically this is like taking the square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m> and glueing its two vertical sides together, where we take care to match up the top corners with the top corners and bottom corners with bottom corners. The result of such an operation is a cylinder, our guess for what <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to.

        <li>
          <p>
            For <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times [0,1]</m>, its equivalence class <m>[(x,y)]_\sim</m> is either <m>\{(x,y)\}</m>, if <m>\{x,y\}\cap\{0,1\}=\emptyset</m>, <m>\{(0,y), (1,y)\}</m> if <m>\{x,y\}\cap \{0,1\}=\{x\}</m>, <m>\{(x,0), (x,1)\}</m> if <m>\{x,y\}\cap \{0,1\}=\{y\}</m>, and <m>\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\}</m> if <m>\{x,y\}\cap \{0,1\}=\{0,1\}</m>. Geometrically this is like taking the square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m>, first glueing its two vertical sides together to get a cylinder, and then glueing the top and bottom edges of this cylinder together to get a doughnut, or torus. Thus we expect <m>X^*</m> is homeomorphic to a torus in <m>\R^3</m>.

  In order to prove our claims in <xref ref="eg_quotient_no_proof"/> we want an easy way to produce a homeomorphism from a quotient space to some other (familiar) topological space. It turns out that the key to doing so lies in identifying a universal mapping property of the map <m>q\colon X\rightarrow X^*</m>. The map <m>q</m> is a special type of map called a <em>quotient map</em>; and as described in <xref ref="th_quot_univ_map"/>, quotient maps enjoy a very useful mapping property that we can exploit to produce homeomorphisms.

      Statement (3) is straightforward. Statement (2) follows easily from (1) using equivalent statements (b) and (c), respectively.

      <title>Proof of (1)</title>
    <p>
      We prove the cycle of implications 
      <me>
        (a)\implies (b)\implies (c)\implies (d)\implies (a)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(a)\implies (b)</m>. Assume <m>f</m> is a quotient map. Let <m>U\subseteq X</m> be open and saturated. Since <m>U</m> is saturated, we have <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> for some set <m>V\subseteq Y</m>. Since <m>f</m> is a quotient map and <m>U</m> is open, the set <m>V</m> is open. Lastly, since <m>f</m> is surjective we have 
      <me>
        f(U)=f(f^{-1}(V))=V
      </me>.
      This proves that <m>f(U)</m> is open for any open <m>U\subseteq X</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(b)\implies (c)</m>. Assume <m>C\subseteq X</m> is closed and saturated. Since <m>C</m> is saturated, we have <m>C=f^{-1}(B)</m> for some <m>B\subseteq Y</m>. Let <m>U=C^c</m>, an open set. Furthermore, since  
      <me>
        U=C^c=(f^{-1}(B))^c=f^{-1}(B^c)
      </me>,
      we see that <m>U</m> is saturated. Using (2), we may conclude that <m>f(U)</m> is open. Again, using the fact that <m>f</m> is surjective, we have 
      <me>
        f(U)=f(f^{-1}(B^c))=B^c
      </me>.
      It follows that <m>B^c</m> is open, and hence <m>B</m> is closed. Since
      <me>
        f(C)=f(f^{-1}(B))=B
      </me>,
      we conclude that <m>f(C)</m> is closed, as desired. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(c)\implies (d)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is assumed to be continuous, we need only show that if <m>f^{-1}(C)</m> is closed, then <m>C</m> is closed. If <m>C'=f^{-1}(C)</m> is closed, then it is a closed saturated set. By (c), we conclude that <m>f(C')</m> is closed. But since <m>f</m> is surjective, we have 
      <me>
        f(C')=f(f^{-1}(C))=C
      </me>.
      Thus <m>C</m> is closed, as desired. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(d)\implies (a)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is assumed to be continuous, we need only show that if <m>f^{-1}(U)</m> is open, then <m>U</m> is open. If <m>V=f^{-1}(U)</m> is open, then <m>V^c=f^{-1}(U^c)</m> is closed. Using (d), we conclude that <m>U^c</m> is closed and hence <m>U</m> is open, as desired.

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume we have <m>g\colon X\rightarrow Z</m> as described. Define <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow Z</m> via the following recipe: given <m>y\in Y</m>, pick any <m>x\in X</m> such that <m>q(x)=y</m> (possible since <m>q</m> is surjective); now define <m>f(y)=g(x)</m>. Two comments:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            To make sure <m>f</m> as described is well-defined, we must make sure that the definition of <m>f(y)</m> does not depend on the choice of <m>x</m> involve: <ie />, if you happen to pick another <m>x'</m> such that <m>q(x')=y</m>, we must make sure that <m>g(x)=g(x')</m>. This is precisely what is guaranteed by the condition that <m>q(x)=q(x')\implies g(x)=g(x')</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since we want <m>g=f\circ p</m>, this definition of <m>f</m> is forced upon us: given <m>y=q(x)</m>, we must have <m>f(y)=f(q(x))=g(x)</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is unique.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Now we must show <m>f</m> is continuous. Given any open <m>V\subseteq Z</m>, to show that the set <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is open, we will make use of the fact that <m>q</m> is a quotient map: namely, it suffices to show that <m>q{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>. But we have
      <me>
        q^{-1}(U)=q^{-1}(f^{-1}(V))=(f\circ q)^{-1}(V)=g^{-1}(V),
      </me>
      since <m>g=f\circ q</m>. Since <m>g</m> is continuous, we conclude that <m>q^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(V)</m> is open, as desired.
    </p>
    
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume <m>f</m> is injective. Since <m>g=f\circ q</m>, given any <m>x,x'\in X</m> with <m>g(x)=g(x')</m>, we have <m>f(q(x))=f(q'(x))</m>. Since <m>f</m> is injective, we conclude <m>q(x)=q(x')</m>, as desired. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Assume <m>g(x)=g(x')\implies q(x)=q(x')</m> for all <m>x,x'\in X</m>. We will show <m>f</m> is injective. To this end suppose <m>f(y)=f(y')</m> for some <m>y=q(x)</m> and <m>y'=q(x')</m>. Since <m>g=f\circ q</m> it follows that <m>g(x)=g(x')</m>, and hence, using our assumption, <m>y=q(x)=q(x')=y'</m>, as desired. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
             If <m>f</m> is a quotient map, then so is the composition <m>g=f\circ q</m> by statement (3) of <xref ref="th_quotientmap_props"/>. Assume <m>g</m> is a quotient map. We know from (1) of the theorem that <m>f</m> is continuous. Furthermore, since <m>g</m> is surjective and <m>g=f\circ q</m>, it follows that <m>f</m> must be surjective. Now suppose <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is open in <m>Y</m>. Since <m>q</m> is continuous, the set <m>W=q^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>. We have 
             <me>
              W=q^{-1}(U)=q^{-1}(f^{-1}(V))=(f\circ q)^{-1}(V)=g^{-1}(V)
             </me>.
             This shows <m>W</m> is an open saturated set with respect to <m>g</m>. Since <m>g</m> is a quotient map, it follows that <m>g(W)</m> is open (<xref ref="th_quotientmap_props"/>).
             As we saw above, <m>p^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(V)</m>, which is a saturated open set of <m>X</m>. Since <m>g</m> is a quotient map, the set <m>g(g^{-1}(V))</m>
             is open. But again, because <m>g</m> is surjective, we have <m>g(g^{-1}(V))=V</m>.

Since <m>U\cap V</m> contains a set of the form <m>(-\epsilon, \epsilon)</m> for some <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>, we see that <m>(-\epsilon, \epsilon)-\{0\}\subseteq U_1\cap U_2</m>.

From <xref ref="th_quot_univ_map"/> we conclude that <m>g</m> gives rise to a bijective continuous function <m>f\colon X^*\rightarrow \R/\Z</m>. Concretely, <m>f</m> takes an equivalence class <m>[t]\in X^*</m> and maps it to the equivalence class <m>\{t+n\colon n\in \Z\}</m> in <m>\R/\Z</m>. Furthermore, to show <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism it is enough to prove that <m>g\colon [0,1]\rightarrow \R/\Z</m>
          is a quotient map. In fact, we can show that <m>g</m> is a closed map. Take a closed set <m>C\subseteq [0,1]</m>. Since <m>q\colon \R\rightarrow \R/\Z</m> is a quotient map, to show its image <m>g(C)</m> is closed in <m>\R/\Z</m> we need only show that <m>q^{-1}(g(C))</m> is closed in <m>\R/\Z</m>. We have 
          <me>
            q^{-1}(g(C))=\{c+n\colon c\in C, n\in \Z\}=\bigcup_{n\in \Z}n+C

Since the map <m>x\mapsto n+x</m> defines a homeomorphism from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>, we see that each <m>n+C</m> is closed. Although in general unions of closed sets are not necessarily closed, using the fact that <m>n+C\subseteq [n,n+1]</m>, it is not difficult to show in this case that <m>\bigcup_{n\in \Z}n+C</m> is closed.

It follows from <xref ref="th_quot_univ_map"/> that the map <m>f</m> is bijective and continuous. Furthermore, by the same result, we can show <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism as long as we can show <m>g</m> is a quotient map. In fact, the map <m>g</m> is open, and hence a quotient map. Given any open set <m>U\subseteq \R</m> and element <m>t_0\in U</m>, we can find an <m>0&lt; \epsilon &lt; 1/4 </m> such that <m>(t_0-\epsilon, t_0+\epsilon)\subseteq U</m>, in which case

            V=g((t_0-\epsilon,t_0+\epsilon))=\{(\cos \theta,\sin\theta)\colon 2\pi t_0-2\pi\epsilon &lt; \theta &lt; 2\pi t_0+2\pi \epsilon\}\subseteq g(U)
          </me>.
          But then <m>V=g((t_0-\epsilon,t_0+\epsilon))</m> is the intersection of <m>S^1</m> with an  <q>open polar rectangle</q> consisting of points <m>P</m> with polar coordinates satisfying

          </md>.
          We showed such open polar rectangles are indeed open in <m>\R^2</m> in <xref ref="eg_polar_coor"/>. It follows that <m>V</m> is an open subset of <m>S^1</m>. Thus for every <m>P=g(t_0)\in g(U)</m> we can find an open set <m>V</m> satisfying <m>P=g(t_0)\in V\subseteq g(U)</m>. It follows that <m>g(U)</m> is open, as desired.
