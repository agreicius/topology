<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> be a connected component of <span class="process-math">\(S^2-C\text{.}\)</span> We first show that <span class="process-math">\(U-\{P\}\)</span> is connected. This is trivial if <span class="process-math">\(P\notin U\text{,}\)</span> so assume <span class="process-math">\(P\in U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is open and <span class="process-math">\(S^2\)</span> is a surface, we can find an open set <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> that is homeomorphic to an open ball in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and which satisfies <span class="process-math">\(x\in W\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span> (In fact, since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a connected component and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is connected, if <span class="process-math">\(P\in W\text{,}\)</span> then we automatically have <span class="process-math">\(W\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span>) Assume by contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(U-\{P\}\)</span>  is not connected, and let <span class="process-math">\(U-\{P\}=A\cup B\)</span> be a separation. Note that <span class="process-math">\(U-\{P\}\)</span> is itself open, and thus so are <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(W-\{P\}\)</span> is connected (homeomorphic to punctured ball) and <span class="process-math">\(W-\{P\}\subseteq U-\{P\}\text{,}\)</span> it must be contained in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Assume without loss of generality that <span class="process-math">\(W-\{P\}\subseteq A\text{.}\)</span> But then we have <span class="process-math">\(A\cup \{P\}=A\cup W\)</span> is open, and thus <span class="process-math">\(U=(A\cup \{P\})\cup B\)</span> is a separation: a contradiction.</div>
