	<title>Continuous functions</title>
	<p>
		In calculus you learn that a function <m>f\colon \R\rightarrow \R</m> is defined to be continuous if for all <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m> there is a <m>\delta &gt; 0</m> such that for all <m>x,x'\in \R</m> we have the implication
		<me>
			\abs{x-x'}&lt; \delta \implies \abs{f(x)-f(x')}&lt; \epsilon
		</me>.
		Now that we have some experience generalizing analysis concepts to topological ones, let's see how best this translates to arbitrary topologies.

			<p>
				Let <m>(X,\mathcal{T}), (Y,\mathcal{T}')</m> be topological spaces.
				A function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is <term>continuous</term> if for all open sets <m>U\subseteq Y</m>, the set <m>f^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.

		<title>Preimage properties</title>
		<p>
			Continuity is defined in terms of <xref ref="d_preimage_of_set" text="custom">preimages of sets</xref> under a function <m>f</m>.
			Thankfully, the preimage operation behaves very well with respect to our various set operations.
			In particular, we have the following identities, which you may make use of without further ado:
			<mdn>
				<mrow>f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i\right) \amp = \bigcup_{i\in I}f^{-1}(A_i)</mrow>
				<mrow>f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i\right) \amp = \bigcap_{i\in I}f^{-1}(A_i)</mrow>
				<mrow> f^{-1}(A^c) \amp =(f^{-1}(A))^c</mrow>

		<title>Continuous functions: basic examples</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<title>Identity function</title>
						<p>
							Given a topological space <m>(X,\mathcal{T})</m>, the identity function
							<md>
								<mrow>\id_X\colon X \amp \rightarrow X</mrow>
								<mrow> x\amp\mapsto x </mrow>
							</md>
							is continuous.
							Here we take <m>\mathcal{T}</m> as the topology of both the domain and codomain.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<title>Constant functions</title>
						<p>
							Let <m>X, Y</m> be topological spaces.
							For any fixed <m>y_0\in Y</m> the constant function <m>f</m>, defined as <m>f(x)=y_0</m> for all <m>x\in X</m> is continuous.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<title>Subspace inclusions</title>
						<p>
							Let <m>Y</m> be a subspace of <m>X</m>.
							The inclusion map <m>i\colon Y\hookrightarrow X</m> is continuous with respect to the subspace topology on <m>Y</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<title>Maps from discrete spaces</title>
						<p>
							If <m>X</m> is equipped with the discrete topology, then any function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> to a topological space <m>Y</m> is continuous.

						<title>Maps to trivial spaces</title>
						<p>
							If <m>Y</m> is equipped with the trivial topology, then any map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> from a topological space to <m>Y</m> is continous.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				These are all pretty elementary.
				I'll prove (3).
				Let <m>Y\subseteq X</m> be a subspace and let <m>i\colon Y\hookrightarrow X</m>  continuous.
				Given any open set <m>U\subseteq X</m>, we have <m>i^{-1}(U)=U\cap Y</m> which by definition is open in the subspace topology.
				Thus <m>i</m> is continuous.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<title>Non-continuous inclusion</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Show that the identity map <m>\id_\R\colon \R\hookrightarrow \R_l</m> is not continuous.
				Here the topology of the domain is the standard one, and the topology on the codomain is the lower limit topology.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				For any <m>U\subseteq \R</m> we have <m>\id_\R^{-1}(U)=U</m>.
				If we choose <m>U</m> to be any open set of <m>\R_l</m> that is not open in the standard topology, it follows that <m>\id_{\R}^{-1}(U)</m> is not open in <m>\R</m> and hence that <m>\id_\R</m> is not continuous.
				We may take <m>U=[0,1)</m> for example.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: let <m>\mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2</m> be two topologies on the set <m>X</m>, and for <m>1\leq i\leq 2</m> let <m>X_i</m> denote the space with underlying set <m>X</m> and topology <m>\mathcal{T}_i</m>.
				The same argument above can be used to show that <m>\id_X\colon X_1\rightarrow X_2</m> is continuous if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}_2\subseteq \mathcal{T}_1</m>.

	<example xml:id="eg_cont_projections">
		<title>Products and projections</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>\{X_i, \mathcal{T}_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topological spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>.
				For each <m>j\in I</m> define the projection function <m>
				\pi_j\colon X\rightarrow X_j</m> as <m>\pi_j((x_i)_{i\in I})=x_i</m>.
				In other words, the <m>j</m>-th projection map returns the <m>j</m>-th coordinate of an element of <m>X</m>.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Prove: if <m>X</m> is given the product topology, then <m>\pi_j</m> is continuous for all <m>j\in J</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Prove: given a topology <m>\mathcal{T}</m> on <m>X</m>, we have <m>\pi_j</m> continuous for all <m>j\in J</m> if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}</m> contains the product topology.
							Thus, in particular, the product topology is the coarsest topology on <m>X</m> making each projection map continuous.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				It is enough to prove (2), since it clearly implies (1).
				The maps <m>\pi_j</m> are continuous in a topology <m>\mathcal{T}</m> if and only if for all <m>j\in I</m> and open <m>U_j\subseteq X_j</m> the preimage <m>\pi_j^{-1}(U_j)=U_j\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> is open in <m>\mathcal{T}</m>.
				Next it clear that <m>U_j\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> is open in <m>\mathcal{T}</m> for all <m>j\in J</m> if and only if
				<me>
					\cap_{k=1}^nU_{j_k}\times \prod_{i\ne j_k}X_i=\prod_{k=1}^n U_{j_k}\times \prod_{i\ne j_k}X_i
				</me>
				is open for any finite set <m>\{j_1, j_2,\dots, j_n\}\subseteq I</m>.
				Since these sets form a basis for the product topology, we conclude that the projections are all continuous if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}</m> is finer than the product topology.

	<theorem xml:id="th_continuity_basis">
		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a function between the topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>, and let <m>\mathcal{B}</m> be a basis for <m>Y</m>.
				The following statements are equivalent.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>f</m> is continuous.

				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>


		<proof>
			<p>
				It is clear that (1) implies (2).
				Assume (2) is true.
				Given open <m>U\subseteq Y</m>, we can write <m>U=\bigcup_{i\in I}B_i</m> with <m>B_i\in \mathcal{B}</m>.
				It follows that
				<me>

				is open, since by assumption each <m>f^{-1}(B_i)</m> is open.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a function between the topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>.
				The following statements are equivalent.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>f</m> is continuous.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							For all <m>A\subseteq X</m>, we have <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq \overline{f(A)}</m>.

					<li>

						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>


		<proof>
			<p>
				<m>(1)\implies (2)</m>.
				Take <m>y\in f(\overline{A})</m>.
				We have <m>y=f(x)</m> for some <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>.
				If <m>V</m> is any open neighborhood of <m>y</m>, then since <m>f</m> is continuous <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
				Since <m>x\in\overline{A}</m>, there exists <m>x'\in A\cap U</m>.
				It follows that <m>y'=f(x')\in V\cap f(A)</m>, showing this intersection is nonempt.
				We concdlue that <m>y\in \overline{f(A)}</m>, as desited.
			</p>

			<p>
				<m>(2)\implies (3)</m>.
				Assume (2) holds of <m>f</m>.
				Given closed <m>C\subseteq Y</m> let <m>A=f^{-1}(C)</m>.
				To show <m>A</m> is closed, we will show that <m>\overline{A}\subseteq A</m>.
				Since <m>A=f^{-1}(C)</m>, this is equivalent to showing <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq C</m>; but this follows from (2) since <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq \overline{f(A)}\subseteq C</m>, where the last inclusion in this chain follows from the fact that <m>C</m> is closed and contains <m>f(A)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<m>(3)\implies (4)</m>.
				Let <m>x\in X</m>, and let <m>V</m> be an open neighborhood of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
				The set <m>C=Y-V</m> is closed, whence <m>f^{-1}(C)=X-f^{-1}(V)</m> is closed.
				It follows that <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m>, and we have <m>f(U)=f(f^{-1}(V))\subseteq V</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<m>(4)\implies (1)</m>.
				We assume (4).
				Let <m>V\subseteq Y</m> be an open set.
				For any <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m>, there is by (4) (taking open set <m>V\ni y=f(x)</m>) an open set <m>U_x\ni x</m> such that <m>f(U_x)\subseteq V</m>.
				It follows that <m>U_x\subseteq f^{-1}(V)</m>.
				Thus for any <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m> there is an open <m>U_x\ni x</m> such that <m>U_x\subseteq V</m>.
				It follows that <m>f^{-1}(V)</m> is open, as desired.

		<proof>
			<p>
				Statements (1)-(3) are elementary, and can be found in Munkres.
			</p>

			<p>
				Statement (4) follows from equivalent condition (4) from <xref ref="th_continuous_equivalence"/>.
				Indeed, take any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>V\ni y=f(x)</m>.
				Since <m>x\in U_i</m> for some <m>i\in I</m>, and since <m>f_i\colon U_i\rightarrow Y</m> is continuous, there is an open <m>U\ni x</m> with <m>U\subseteq U_i</m>, such that <m>f(U)\subseteq V</m>.
				Since <m>U</m> is open in <m>U_i</m> and <m>U_i</m> is open in <m>X</m>, we conclude <m>U</m> is open in <m>X</m>, as desired.
			</p>

			<p>
				To prove statement (5) we show that <m>h^{-1}(A)</m> is closed for any closed set <m>A\subseteq Y</m>.
				Since <m>h(x)\in A</m> if and only if <m>x\in C</m> and <m>f(x)\in A</m> or <m>x\in D</m> and <m>g(x)\in A</m>, we have <m>h^{-1}(A)=f^{-1}(A)\cup g^{-1}(A)</m>.
				Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are closed we have <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> closed in <m>C</m> and <m>g^{-1}(A)</m>
				closed in <m>D</m>.
				Since <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are closed, transitivity of closedness implies <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> and <m>g^{-1}(A)</m> are closed in <m>X</m>.
				We conclude <m>h^{-1}(A)=f^{-1}(A)\cup g^{-1}(A)</m> is closed, as desired.
