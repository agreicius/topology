        <title>Urysohn lemma</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            Let <m>X</m> be a normal space. Given two nonempty disjoint closed sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> such that <m>f(A)=\{0\}</m> and <m>f(B)=\{1\}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It follows easily that the result is still true if we replace the interval <m>[0,1]</m> with any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                It would be difficult to improve upon Munkres' exposition of this. I give essentially a full proof below nonetheless.
            </p>
            <proof>
                <title>Step 1: construction of open sets <m>U_p</m></title>
                    <p>
                      The first crucial step in the proof is to build a collection of open sets <m>\{U_p\}_{p\in \Q}</m> satisfying <m>\overline{U_p}\subseteq U_{q}</m> if <m>p&lt; q</m>. This is done by first 
                      picking an enumeration of <m>\Q\cap [0,1]=\{p_1,p_2,\dots,\}</m> where for convenience <m>p_1=1</m> and <m>p_2=0</m>. We use the enumeration to define open sets <m>U_p</m> for each <m>p\in \Q</m> recursively as follows. Set <m>U_1=X-B</m>. Since <m>A\subseteq U_1</m>, by <xref ref="th_regular_normal_equivalence"/> we can find an open <m>U_0</m> containing <m>A</m> such that <m>\overline{U}_0\subseteq U_1</m>. Now take any <m>n\geq 2</m> and assume by induction that we constructed open sets <m>U_{p_1}, U_{p_2},\dots, U_{p_n}</m> satisfying the desired inclusion condition. Write <m>p&lt; p_{n+1} &lt; q</m> where  <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are the immediate predecessor and successor, respectively, of <m>p_{n+1}</m> among the set <m>\{p_1,p_2,\dots, p_n\}</m>. By induction we have <m>\overline{U_p}\subseteq U_q</m>. Pick <m>U_{p_{n+1}}</m> to be any open set satisfying 
                      <me>
                        \overline{U_p}\subseteq U_{p_{n+1}}\subseteq \overline{U_{p_{n+1}}}\subseteq U_q
                      </me>.
                      Lastly define <m>U_p=\emptyset</m> for all <m>p&lt; 0</m> and <m>U_p=X</m> for all <m>p&gt; 0</m>. It is easy to see that thus defined, our collection <m>\{U_p\}_{p\in \Q}</m> satisfies the desired inclusion condition. 
                    </p>
                </proof>
                <proof>
                    <title>Step 2: definition of <m>f</m> and continuity</title>
                    <p>
                    Define <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R</m> as 
                    <me>
                        f(x)=\inf\{p\in \Q\colon x\in U_p\}
                    </me>.
                    Some easy properties of <m>f</m>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>0\leq f(x)\leq 1</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>f(x)\leq p</m> for all <m>x\in \overline{U_p}</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>f(x)\geq p</m> for all <m>x\notin U_p</m>. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    We prove continuity by showing that <m>f</m> is continuous at each <m>x</m>. Given <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>y=f(x)</m>, choose rational numbers <m>p, q</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        a&lt; p&lt; y &lt; q &lt; b
                    </me>.
                    I claim <m>U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m> satisfying 
                    <me>
                        f(U_q-\overline{U_p})\subseteq [p,q]\subseteq (a,b)
                    </me>. 
                    First, it is clear that <m>U_q-\overline{U_p}</m> is open, and it follows easily from the elementary properties of <m>f</m> quoted above that <m>x\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>. Next, given any <m>x'\in U_q-\overline{U_p}</m>, since <m>x'\in \overline{U_q}</m>, we have <m>f(x')\leq q</m>, and since <m>x'\notin U_p</m>, we have <m>f(x')\geq p</m>. This concludes the proof.

        <p>
         With respect to regularity, separation by a continuous function is truly a stronger notion: <ie/>, there are spaces that are regular but not completely regular. This is in contrast to the situation with normality: by Urysohn's lemma a space is normal if and only if disjoint closed sets are separated by a continuous function. Note also that by Urysohn's lemma, any normal space is completely regular. Thus adding <m>T_{3\frac{1}{2}}</m> to our list of <foreign>Trennungsaxiome</foreign> we still have a list of properties that satisfies <m>T_n\implies T_m</m> if <m>n\geq m</m>.

        The notion of complete regularity strikes a nice balance between regularity and normality. In particular, it is stronger than regularity, but still behaves well with respect to subspaces and products.

                The proof of (1) is elementary. (See text.) The proof of (2) is more interesting. Assume <m>\{X_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a collection of completely regular spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>. Let <m>A\subseteq X</m> be a closed set, and let <m>b=(b_i)_{i\in I}</m> be any element not contained in <m>A</m>. Since <m>X-A</m> is open, we can find a base open neighborhood of <m>b</m> of the form <m>U=\prod_{k=1}^n U_{i_k}\times \prod_{i\ne i_k}X_i</m>. For each <m>1\leq k\leq n</m> let <m>f_k\colon X_{i_k}\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a continuous function satisfying <m>f_k(b_{i_k})=1, f_k(U_{i_k}^c)=\{0\}</m>.  The function

        <title>Urysohn metrization theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            If <m>X</m> is a regular second countable space, then <m>X</m> is metrizable. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                The main step in the proof, one that uses <xref ref="th_Urysohn_lemma"/>, is the construction of a countable family of continuous functions <m>\{f_n\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]\}_{n\in \Z_+}</m> satisfying the following property: for all <m>x\in X</m> and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, there is an <m>n\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>f_n(x)>0</m> and <m>f_n(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. It then follows from <xref ref="th_embedding_theorem"/> that the map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow \R^\omega</m> defined as <m>f(x)=(f_n(x))_{n\in \Z_+}</m> is an embedding into the metric space <m>\R^\omega</m>. Since subspaces of metric spaces are metric spaces, we conclude that <m>X</m> is metrizable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We now proceed with the construction. Let <m>\mathcal{B}=\{B_1, B_2,\dots, \}</m> be a countable basis of <m>X</m>. For all <m>m,n\in \Z_+</m> satisfying <m>\overline{B_m}\subseteq B_n</m>, let <m>g_{m,n}\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a continuous function satisfying <m>g_{m,n}(\overline{B_m})=\{1\}</m> and <m>g_{m,n}(X-B_n)=\{0\}</m>: this guaranteed to exist by <xref ref="th_Urysohn_lemma"/> since <m>X</m>, being regular and second countable, is normal. Since the collection <m>\{g_{m,n}\}</m> is countable we can enumerate it as <m>\{g_{m,n}\}=\{f_1, f_2,\dots\}</m>. Now, for any <m>x</m> and any open set <m>U\ni x</m>, we have <m>x\in B_n\subseteq U</m> for some <m>n\in \Z_+</m>. Since <m>X</m> is regular, we can find a basis element <m>B_m</m> such that <m>x\in \overline{B_m}\subseteq B_n</m>. We have <m>g_{m,n}=f_k</m> for some <m>k\in \Z_+</m>, <m>f_k(x)=1</m>, and <m>f_k(X-U)\subseteq f_k(X-B_m)=\{0\}</m>, as desired.

            Munkres gives an alternative proof that shows any regular second countable space can be embedded into <m>\R^\omega</m> with respect to the uniform metric.

                A space <m>X</m> is completely regular if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>[0,1]^I</m> for some set <m>I</m>.

        <proof>
            <p>
                Implication: <m>(\Rightarrow)</m>. Assume <m>X</m> is completely regular. Recall that in particular this means <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m>. Define <m>I</m> to be the set of all pairs <m>(x, U)</m> where <m>x\in X</m> and <m>U</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>. For each <m>i=(x,U)</m>, let <m>f_i\colon X\rightarrow [0,1]</m> be a function satisfying <m>f(x)=1</m> and <m>f(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. (Such a function exists since <m>X</m> is completely regular.) Now, for all <m>x\in X</m> and for all open sets <m>U</m> containing <m>x</m>, corresponding to the index <m>i=(x,U)</m> we have the function <m>f_i</m> which satisfies <m>f_i(x)=1&gt; 0</m> and <m>f_i(X-U)=\{0\}</m>. We conclude by <xref ref="th_embedding_theorem"/> that the map <m>f(x)=(f_i(x))_{i\in I}</m> is an embedding of <m>X</m> into <m>\R^I</m>, and thus that <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>\R^I</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implication: <m>(\impliedby)</m>. Since <m>\R</m> is completely regular, and since complete regularity is preserved under arbitrary products, the space <m>\R^I</m> is completely regular for any set <m>I</m>. Furthermore, since complete regularity is inherited by subspaces, any subspace of <m>\R^I</m> is completely regular. Thus, if <m>X</m> embeds into <m>\R^I</m>, then it is homeomorphic to a subspace of <m>\R^I</m>, and hence is completely regular.
