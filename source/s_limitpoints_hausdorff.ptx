              The <m>T_1</m> is called a <em>separation axiom</em>, or <em>Trennungsaxiom</em> in German: hence the <sq>T</sq>. To see more explicitly why this is called a separation axiom, note that (a) <m>T_1</m> is equivalent to the property that any singleton is closed, and (b) this in turn is equivalent to saying for any two elements <m>x\ne y</m> there is an open neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>y</m> that does not contain <m>x</m>; we think of this <m>U</m> as separating <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

            <p>
              We provide a counterexample to the claim that <m>T_1</m> implies Hausdorff. Let <m>X</m> be any <em>infinite</em> set endowed with the cofinite topology. The closed sets of <m>X</m> are precisely the finite sets and <m>X</m> itself, as we saw in <xref ref="eg_closed_cofinite"/>. Thus <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m>. On the other hand, <m>X</m> is not Hausdorff. Indeed take any two distinct elements <m>x, y\in X</m>. Let <m>U_x</m> and <m>U_y</m> be any pair of open neighborhoods of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. We will show that <m>U_x\cap U_y\ne \emptyset</m>. If either of the open neighborhoods is equal to <m>X</m> itself, the claim is obvious. Otherwise <m>C=U_x^c</m> is a finite set that does not contain <m>x</m> and <m>D=U_y^c</m> is a finite set that does not contain <m>y</m>.
              Since <m>X</m> is infinite, <m>X\ne C\cup D</m>, and hence
              <me>
              U_x\cap U_y=C^c\cap D^c=(C\cup D)^c\ne \emptyset
              </me>,
              as desired.
