<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">Since the <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span>-topology is finer than the standard topology on <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\R_K\)</span> is Hausdorff. To see that it is not regular, recall that <span class="process-math">\(K=\{1/n\colon n\in \Z_+\}\)</span> is closed. I'll show that we cannot separate 0 and <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> with open sets. Indeed, suppose we have open disjoint sets <span class="process-math">\(U, V\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(0, K\)</span> respectively. Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is open, it must contain an open basis element $B$ containing <span class="process-math">\(0\text{;}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(U\cap K=\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> this basis element can be chosen of the form <span class="process-math">\((-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K\text{.}\)</span> Now choose <span class="process-math">\(n\in \Z_+\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(1/n\in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(1/n\in K\)</span> we can find a basis element of the form <span class="process-math">\((1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\)</span> that is contained in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, shrinking <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> if necessary, we can assume that <span class="process-math">\((1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\subseteq (-\epsilon, \epsilon)\text{.}\)</span> But then clearly <span class="process-math">\((1/n-\delta, 1/n+\delta)\cap \left((-\epsilon, \epsilon)-K\right)\ne\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and hence also <span class="process-math">\(U\cap V\ne \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Contradiction!</div></div></body>
