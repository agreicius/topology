  "body": " Sets and functions    We gather here some notions about sets and functions.    Sets   sets  sets empty sets  sets membership      set membership   Sets   A set is a collection of objects. An object is a member (or element ) of a set if contains . In this case, we write . If is not a member of , we write .    We use curly braces to describe the contents of a set. For example, is the set containing the first three positive integers, and is the set of all positive integers. The defining property of sets is that they are completely determined by their members, and nothing more. In particular, when describing sets as above, it does not matter in what order the elements are listed, nor if they are repeated: , , , and are three descriptions of the same set. This somewhat slippery notion is made perfectly clear by specifying exactly what it means for two sets to be equal, as we do below.   Set equality  sets equality   Sets and are equal , denoted , if they have precisely the same elements: , if for any object , we have if and only if .    Set membership naturally extends to a notion of one set lying within another.   Set inclusion (subsets)  sets subset  sets inclusion    set inclusion    A set is a subset of a set , denoted , if every member of is a member of : , implies for any object . The relation is called set inclusion .      The definitions of set equality and the subset relation make use of two important logical operations: namely, the if and only if (or iff for short) and if-then operations.    With the fundamental notions of membership, equality, and subset in place, we now introduce means of building new sets from existing ones. The first is a manner of carving out a subset of a given set using a specified property.   Set-builder notation  sets set builder notation   Let be a set, and let be a property that elements of either satisfy or do not satisfy. For an element , let denote the statement that satisfies . The set of all elements of satisfying is denoted .      Set builder notation is parsed from left to right as follows:    is read as the set of      is read as elements of      is read as such that      is read as is true .   Taken altogether we get: The set of elements of such that is true .      Let be the set of nonnegative integers. The subset of even positive integers can be described using set-builder notation as , or alternatively, .    Next we use set builder notation, the set membership relation, and some basic logic to define the union, intersection, and difference of sets.   Union, intersection, difference, and complement  sets union  sets intersection    set union     set intersection   sets complement  sets difference      set difference     set complement    Let and be subsets of a common set .    Set union  The union  of and is defined as . More generally, if is a set and is a collection of sets indexed by , then the union  of this collection is defined as .    Set intersection  The intersection  of and is defined as . More generally, if is a set and is a collection of sets indexed by , then the intersection  of this collection is defined as     Set difference  The difference  is defined as .    Set complement  The complement of in is defined as . In contexts where there is clear what the larger set is, we denote the complement of in as .      With the help of these set operations, we can now describe some common sets used in mathematics.   sets empty set     the empty set   real numbers    real numbers   integers    integers     positive integers   rational numbers    rational numbers   Common mathematical sets   We denote by the set of all real numbers. The integers  and rational numbers  are the subsets of defined as . This yields the following chain of subsets: . The empty set is the set containing no objects, denoted or .  The set of all positive integers is denoted .    The power set of a set is the set of all subsets of . We will make use of this notion in our very first definition ( ).   power set    power set of   Power set   Given a set , its power set  is defined as the set of all subsets of .     Power set   Let . The power set is the set of all subsets of . We can enumerate systematically by listing all the subsets in order of increasing cardinality. There is one subset of containing zero elements: namely, the empty set . The two subsets of containing exactly one element are and . Lastly, the unique subset of containing two elements is itself. We conclude that . In general if has cardinality , then has cardinality .    Lastly, we define the cartesian product of sets, which is a formal description of an ordered collection of objects.   Cartesian product finite      Cartesian product   Cartesian product (finite)   An -tuple (or sequence ) of the sets is an ordered list such that for all . We define two -tuples , and to be equal, denoted , if for all . We call the length of the sequence , and we call its -th entry for all .  The (Cartesian) product of the sets , denoted or , is the set of all -tuples: , .  Given a set , its -ary Cartesian product  is defined as .      We have more suggestive names for -tuples when is small: a 2-tuple is called a pair, a 3-tuple is called a triple, a 4-tuple is called a quadruple, . We will use the generic term tuple to designate a -tuple of unspecified length.      Observe how tuples capture the notion of an ordered collection of object. For example, whereas the sets and are all equal to one another, the 4-tuples and are not: they differ in their second entries.  What about the tuples and ? Are these equal? Technically our definition of equality only applies to tuples living in the same fixed Cartesian product. In particular, for the question of equality to make sense, the tuples must have the same length. As such we will officially avoid writing things like , although unofficially we consider these two objects as completely different. You should think of and as creatures living on two different planets in the universe of tuples.    The notion of a Cartesian product can be generalized to an infinite list of sets , and indeed to any collection indexed by a set .   tuple arbitrary    -tuple   I-tuple   Let be a set. Given a set , an -tuple of elements of is a function . Given an -tuple and element we will often denote the value as , and denote itself as . In analogy to finite tuples, we call the -th entry or coordinate of .     Cartesian product arbitrary    Cartesian product of the sets   Cartesian product (arbitrary)   Let be a set, and let be a collection of subsets indexed by the set . The Cartesian product  of this collection is defined as . In other words, the Cartesian product is the set of all -tuples of elements of whose -th coordinate is an element of for all .  In the special case where for all , we denote as .      Functions   Functions  function    a function from to    Let and be two sets. A function from to , denoted , is a rule which, given any input  , returns an output  . In this case we write and call the image of under , or the value of at  . Similarly, we say  maps (or sends ) the input to the output .  The set is called the domain of ; the set is called the codomain of .  When we wish to indicate what rule defines the function, we use the elaborated notation . This is read as The function with domain and codomain maps an input to the output .      Consider the function . This function has domain and codomain equal to and maps an integer to its square.     Arithmetic operations as functions   Our familiar arithmetic operations can be expressed as functions whose inputs are pairs of numbers: addition is the function and multiplication is the function       Invoking the notion of a rule in the definition of a function is admittedly somewhat vague. A more precise definition can be given using the Cartesian product. Namely, given sets and , we define a function to be a subset satisfying the following property: for all there is a unique element . The uniqueness of the pair then allows us to define the value of at as , denoted .    As with sets and tuples, we are obliged to specify what we mean for two functions to be equal. The definition below makes clear how the the domain and codomain, as well as the rule that takes inputs to outputs, are all essential ingredients of a function.   Function equality  function equality   Functions and are equal if   they have the same domain and codomain , and    for all , we have .        Image of a set  function image of a set  function image    image of the set under     image of a function    Given a function and a subset , the image of under , denoted , is defined as . In other words, is the set of all outputs , where .  The image of , denoted , is the set of all outputs of : , .     Preimage of set  preimage of a set    preimage of under    Given a function , the preimage of a subset is the subset defined as . In plain English: the preimage of under is the set of all whose image under lies in .     Injective, surjective, bijective  invertible function  bijective function  injective function  surjective function  one-to-one function  onto function  one-to-one correspondence   Let be a function.   The function is injective (or one-to-one ) if for all , if , then : equivalently, if , then .    The function is surjective (or onto ) if for all , there is an such that : equivalently, .    The function is bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence ) if it is injective and surjective.        Role of domain and codomain in injectivity and surjectivity   Consider the following three functions . Although all three functions are defined using the same rule ( ), they are not equal thanks to their differing domains and\/or codomains. The choice of domain and codomain in these examples also plays a crucial role in determining whether the function is injective and\/or surjective. The function is neither injective ( ) nor surjective ( ); the function is injective but not surjective; the function is both injective and surjective, hence bijective.     Function composition  function composition    the composition of and    Suppose and are functions satisfying . The composition of and is the function defined as , for all .     function invertible  function inverse  function identity  Identity and inverse functions   For any set the identity function on is the function defined as for all .  A function is invertible if there is a function satisfying and : , . The function in this case is called the inverse of , denoted .    Invertible is equivalent to bijective   A function is invertible if and only if it is bijective.       Cardinality and countability   Cardinality  cardinality  finite set  infinite set  countably infinite set  countable set  uncountable set    cardinality of set    Let be a set.    Finite and infinite sets  The set is finite if either or there is a bijection for some positive integer . Roughly speaking, the cardinality of a finite set , denoted , is the number of distinct elements it contains. In more detail if , then by definition; if there is a bijection , then .  The set is infinite if it is not finite. In this case is said to have infinite cardinality .    Countable and uncountable sets  The set is countably infinite if there is a bijection , where is the set of all positive integers; it is countable if it is either finite or countable infinite.  The set is uncountable if it is not countable.       "

Logical operators      Negation  Given a proposition , the negation of is the proposition Not , denoted in logical notation, the truth value of which is defined as follows: is true exactly when is false.    Conjunction (logical and)  Given propositions and , their conjuction is the proposition and , denoted in logical notation, the truth value of which is defined as follows: is true when both and are true, and false otherwise.    Disjunction (logical or)  Given propositions and , their disjunction is the proposition or , denoted in logical notation, the truth value of which is defined as follows: is true when at least one of and is true, and false otherwise.    Logical implication (if-then)  Given propositions and , the proposition If , then , denoted in logical notation, is called an implication , and its truth value is defined as follows: is false when is true and is false, and true otherwise.    Logical equivalence (if and only if)  Given propositions and , the proposition if and only if , denoted in logical notation, is called an equivalence , and its truth value is defined as follows: is true when and have the same truth value, and false otherwise. We say and are logically equivalent when is true.         A truth table of a compound proposition is a concise way of displaying how the truth value of depends on the truth values of its component propositions. It contains one row for each possible truth assignment of the component propositions. As illustration, we give the truth tables for the logical operators defined above:       Use a truth table to find all truth value assignments of and making the compound proposition false.    We construct a truth table with columns for , , , , and : . We conclude that is false exactly when is false and is true. (It follows that is equivalent to . )      Our definitions of the logical operators above are chosen to agree with their usage in a very particular type of discourse: namely, mathematical discourse. They do not always agree with their use in natural language: hence the modifier logical in their titles.  For example, disjunctions in natural language of the form or are often understood to be true when is true or is true, but not both . This notion of disjunction is called the exclusive or in logic, in contrast to the standard logical or.  Similarly, according to our definition, the implication If the President of the US is a dog, then the Vice President of the US is a cat is true, since the proposition The President of the US is a dog is false. (In logic we say the implication is vacuously true in this case.) However, working outside of our logical definitions of truth value, we may have been inclined to treat this implication as false, since both The President of the US is a dog and The Vice President of the US is a cat are false.      Predicate logic  Propositions like All humans are mortal and Every positive real number has a square-root are modeled in logic in the form For all , and For all , there exists an such that , where stands for the phrase is mortal and stands for the phrase is a square-root of . Observe that and on their own are not propositions; there is no truth value to is mortal or is a square-root of . Instead, we think of and as functions which return propositions when evaluated at a specific choice for , or for and . For example, evaluating at yields the proposition Aaron Greicius is mortal , which happens to be true at the time of writing. Similarly evaluating at yields the proposition is a square-root of 2 , which happens to be false. In logic and are called propositional functions (also called predicates ): functions whose outputs are propositions.  The propositions For all , and For all , there exists an such that are obtained from and by bounding them with a series of quantifiers ( , for all , there exists an ). The definition below allows us to assign truth values to such propositions.    Let be a set, and let be a propositional function that assigns to all elements the proposition . The set is called the domain of discourse of .    Universal quantifier  The proposition For all in , , denoted in logical notation, is called a universal quantification , and its truth value is defined as follows: is true if for all elements of , the proposition is true; it is false if there is some such that is false.    Existential quantifier  The proposition There exists an in such that , denoted in logical notation, is called an existential quantification , and its truth value is defined as follows: is true if there is some element of for which the proposition is true; it is false if is false for all .       Truth depends on domain of discourse   Just as a function is not properly defined before its domain is specified, we do not have a well-defined propositional function, nor well-defined truth values of propositions built from this propositional function, until its domain of discourse is given.  For example, let be x>0 . If we declare , then the proposition is true, since by definition every is positive. On the other hand, if we declare , the proposition is false since not all elements of are positive: indeed, is negative, making false.  Because of the important role played by the domain of discourse , we sometimes include it in our quantifier expressions: , , . Using this convention allows us to see more immediately that is true and is false.     Modeling Every positive number has a square-root   Model the sentence Every positive real number has a square-root in the form , where is a propositional function with domain of discourse . Determine the truth value of using .    Fix our domain of discourse to be . For any , let be the proposition that is a square-root of . Define to be the propositional function . Thus for any , is the proposition that if is positive, then has a square-root. It follows that is the proposition that for all real numbers , if is positive, then has a square-root. This is clearly equivalent to the proposition that every positive real number has a square-root, as desired.  Lastly, we use to show is true. Take any . The real number is either positive or not positive. If is not positive, then is false and hence , which is the implication , is true vacuously. If is positive, then is true, and is true, since has a square-root in this case: namely, . But if is true and is true, then the implication is true. We have proved is true for all . Thus is true.     Order of quantifiers matters   As illustrates, we can take a propositional function in two variables and quantify one of the two variables to obtain a propositional function in one variable: , or . Proceeding in this manner we engender propositions involving sequences of quantifiers. Mark well that the order of the quantifiers in such sequences is important!  For example, letting be is a square-root of with domain of discourse . The proposition says that every positive real number has a positive square-root (true); the proposition says that there is a positive real number that is the square-root of all real numbers (false).  In general to unpack a sequence of quantifiers we start from the leftmost quantifier and proceed to the right.     Negating quantifiers   Let be a propositional function with domain of discourse . According to a universal quantification is false if it is not the case that is true for all for all ; that is, if there is some such that is false. Letting be the propositional function defined as for all , we see that is false if and only if is true. This proves the equivalence . Similarly, we have . These equivalences can be understood as rules of negating quantifier statements. They can be summarized as follow: swap quantifiers and negate the predicate.     The example below taken from calculus nicely illustrates how to negate a proposition that involves a sequence of quantifiers.   The limit does not exist   Let be a function with domain , and let be a point of this domain. By definition, the proposition that exists is equivalent to the following proposition: . (We made a number of shortcuts in our logical notation above (  , ) in order to simplify the expression somewhat; the intended meaning should still be clear. )  Use the negation rules described in to derive a similar proposition equivalent to the statement that do not exist.    Let be the proposition in . Using the negation rules in series, we derive the chain of equivalences below. We've added parentheses to emphasize what is being negated at each step. Note how a quantifiers are swapped each time we pass the negation to the right. . (The last link in our chain uses the fact that is equivalent to , as a truth table easily shows.) Translating back into English, we conclude that the limit not existing ( ) is equivalent to the following: for every there is an such that for all there exists an satisfying and . Quite a mouthful!     "

  "body": " Proof techniques  Proof writing is an art, a technical skill you will hone and refine throughout your career; and like any art, proof writing has many tricks of the trade. We gather a few here in the form of a collection of general proof techniques. Part of mastering these techniques involves understanding the circumstances where they can be of use. When selecting a technique, we are guided in part by the logical structure and particular mathematical content of the proposition under consideration. The proof techniques below are organized under this guiding principle.   Logical structure   Implication  By the only time an implication is false is when is true and is false. Accordingly, the direct approach to proving an implication is to assume is true, and use this assumption to prove is true.  A common indirect approach used to prove an implication is to prove its contrapositive  , which is logically equivalent to the original implication. In this case we assume is not true, and show is not true. (Exercise: use a truth table to show the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.)    The converse of an implication is the implication ; the inverse of is the implication . Neither the converse nor the inverse is equivalent to the original implication, and thus neither of these can be used to give an indirect proof of . (Exercise: use a truth table to show that neither the converse nor the inverse implication is logically equivalent to the original implication. )      Disjunction  Again, using , to directly show a disjunction is true, we need only show one the two component propositions is true.  Alternatively, we can prove either of the implications or , both of which are logically equivalent to . (Exercise: use a truth table to show these three propositions are indeed equivalent!)    Equivalence The equivalence is logically equivalent to the conjunction . Accordingly, the standard way of proving is to prove the two implications and separately. (Exercise: use a truth table to show these propositions are indeed equivalent!)   Chains of implications\/equivalences  The relation implies is transitive: , if and , then . Similarly, the relation is equivalent to is transitive. This allows us to prove an implication or equivalence via a chain of implications or chain of equivalences . When writing up a proof using this technique, use a vertically aligned format like the example below, treating one implication or equivalence per line, and adding a brief justification to the right: . It is also possible to build an argument as a hybrid chain of equivalences and implications. In this case the chain is only as strong as its weakest link. For example, a chain of the form only shows that . Indeed, we will have if and only if the intervening implication is in fact an equivalence ( , the arrow goes both ways).    It is often tempting, for the sake of space, to try and prove an equivalence via a chain of equivalences, as opposed to showing and separately. When proceeding in this manner, make doubly sure that each is indeed an equivalence: , that the implication arrow really goes both ways at each step. Even if each step in your chain truly is an equivalence, you should consider whether this will be obvious to your reader.    The example below provides the proof that a function is invertible if and only if it is bijective ( ). The proof nicely illustrates some of the different techniques used for proving implications and equivalences. Additionally, it is a nice example of how to separate out cases of the argument into clearly distinguished steps.   Proof: invertible is equivalent to bijective   Let be a function. Prove: is invertible if and only if is bijective.    Let be the proposition that is invertible, and let be the proposition that is bijective. We prove the equivalence by proving the two implications and .   Proof of  We must show that if is invertible, then is bijective. Assume is invertible. Then has an inverse . We show separately that is injective and surjective, hence bijective.   is injective  We show via a chain of implications: .    is surjective  Let be an element of . We must show that there is an such that . Letting , we have .     Proof of  We must show that if is bijective, then is invertible. Assume is bijective. First we define a function as follows: for all , let be the unique element such that . Note that our definition of uses both that is surjective (there is some element such that )) and injective (there is exactly one element such that ).  We now prove that is the inverse of , showing and separately.    Take any and let . By definition of , we have and hence . This proves .     Take any . By definition of , is the unique such that . Thus . This proves .        Proof by contradiction The technique of proof by contradiction (or reductio ad absurdum ) proves a proposition by (a) assuming the negation is true, and then (b) using this assumption to derive a proposition known to be false. The choice of falsehood is completely up to the person providing the proof. However, in order for the proof to be convincing, it should be clear, either logically or because of theory assumed to be known, that is indeed false.  Proof by contradiction   Prove by contradiction that has no multiplicative inverse in the reals: , there is no such that .    We prove the claim by contradiction. Assume there is an such that . Since for any (a property of multiplication by 0), we have : a contradiction since . We conclude that there is no such that .      Proof by contradiction resembles, but is not quite the same thing as proving an implication via its contrapositive. Letting denote an arbitrary falsehood (the described above) what we do in a proof by contradiction is show that the implication is true. Since is false, and the implication is true, must be false: equivalently, must be true.       Equalities   Equality is not as simple as it may seem. In general an equality is a mathematical statement of the form . Here LHS and RHS stand for left- and right-hand side, respectively. What exactly such an equality means depends very much on what kind of mathematical objects the two sides of the equation are: , numbers, sets, functions, etc. Below we discuss equality for objects of a particular type in detail. (See and .) In all settings, the notion of equality will be transitive : , if and , then . We use transitivity implicitly when proving an equality via a chain of equalities as described below.    Chain of equalities Often to prove an equality as in we proceed in a sequence of intervening bite-size equalities, each of which is easy for the reader to digest. As with chains of implications\/equivalences, we present such an argument in a vertically aligned format, with brief justifications to the right: .  Never attempt to prove an equality by starting off with the equality you wish to prove, and then deduce a series of further equalities ending in some inanity: , . What this suggests is that you are in fact proving an implication: namely, if the desired equality is true, then  . Clearly this is not what we set out to prove! This type of fallacious argument is called begging the question ( petitio princippii in Latin), as we assume that which was to be proven.      Basic set properties   Set inclusion  Let and be sets. By , to prove we must show that for all elements we have . This requires proving the implication above for a general element , and we may use any of the techniques described in and to do so.    Set equality  Let and be sets. To prove directly using we must show that for all elements we have . To prove this universal equivalence, we must give an argument for the equivalence that holds for a general element .  Alternatively, you can prove by proving the two set inclusions and separately. This is equivalent to proving the two implications and separately.     Basic function properties   Function equality  By , in order to show functions and are equal we must   show that and have the same domain and codomain , and    show that for all .    By The universal quantifier for all of item (ii) gives this subtask the feel of proving an identity : we must show that equality holds for all  . By the same token, to show (ii) does not hold, it suffices to show that for some .   Injective, surjective, bijective  Let be a function.   Injectivity  To show is injective, we must show that the implication holds for all . Frequently it will be convenient to prove the (universal) contrapositive: for all .  Similarly, to show is not injective, we simply have to find satisfying and .    Surjectivity  To prove is surjective, we must prove the universal quantification: . To prove is not surjective, we must prove the negation of this proposition ( ): , there exists a for which there is no with .    Bijectivity  To show is bijective directly using , we must show that is injective and surjective. This is equivalent to showing that for there exists a unique element such that .  Alternatively, using we can show that is bijective by providing an inverse function .      mathematical induction  Mathematical induction    Mathematical induction is a technique for proving universal quantifications of the form , where is a fixed starting integer, called the base , and is a predicate defined on the integers. If the setting makes clear that ranges over integers, we write such propositions using logical notation as .    mathematical induction weak induction  Proof by induction  Suppose is a predicate of integers. To prove the proposition by induction (sometimes called weak induction ), we proceed in two steps.   Base step  Show that is true.    Induction step  Prove the universal implication . In practice, if proving the implication directly, this means we assume is true (the induction hypothesis ), and use this assumption to show is true.    Step 0 of induction   When meeting a proposition in the wild that we wish to prove by induction, you should first take care to model the proposition in the form . Make explicit the predicate in question, as well as the base case . We illustrate this preparatory Step 0 in the examples below.     Weak induction   Prove the identity for all . Recall: .    We prove the proposition by induction.   Step 0: preparation  The proposition is modeled logically as , where is the proposition that .    Base step:  The proposition is the statement that , which is clearly true.    Induction step  We must show the universal implication . Let , and assume is true: , The proposition states that . We prove this, assuming , via a chain of equalities: , as desired.   Having completed our base and induction steps, our proof is now finished.    So why does proof by induction work? In other words, why is it a valid proof technique? Imagine our propositions as forming an infinite ladder that we wish to ascend. Cautious climbers that we are, we only will step on a rung if we know the corresponding proposition is true. Knowing is true (the base step) allows us to step onto the first rung. The universal implication (induction step) gives us a rule that says if rung is secure (i.e., true), then so is rung . Since this rule holds for all rungs (i.e., for all ), we can safely ascend the entire ladder!  Mathematical induction as ladder of propositions  Mathematical induction as ladder of propositions          mathematical induction strong induction  Proof by strong induction  Suppose is a predicate of integers. To prove the proposition by strong induction , we proceed in two steps.   Base step:  Show that is true.    Strong induction step  Prove the universal implication . This technique is called strong induction, as now the induction hypothesis is much stronger: to prove this implication directly we assume is true for all (not just as in weak induction), and use this assumption to show is true.   In fact, strong induction is, logically speaking, no stronger than weak induction. Both techniques apply to propositions of the form , and you are free to choose which form of induction to use each time. We typically use strong induction out of convenience, when the nature of the predicate is such that we can prove most elegantly by assuming , as opposed to just . The following example is characteristic in this regard.   Strong induction   Prove that every integer can be written as a product of primes.    We prove the statement by induction.   Step 0: preparation  The proposition is modeled logically as , where is the proposition that is a product of primes.    Base step:  The proposition asserts that is a product of primes. This is true since is itself prime, hence a product of one prime number.    Strong induction step  We must show the universal implication . Let , and assume is true for all : , for all such we assume can be written as a product of primes. We use this assumption to prove : , that is a product of primes. We proceed in two cases, depending on whether is itself prime.   Case 1: is prime  If is prime, then it is trivially a product of one prime number, just as with the base case.    Case2 : is not prime  If is not prime, then we can factor nontrivially as . Here nontrivially means that we have . Using the strong induction hypothesis, we may assume that and are both products of primes: , we have , where and are prime for all and . It follows that , and hence that is also a product of primes, as desired.    Having completed the base and induction steps, our proof by induction is now finished.      "

  "title": "Topological spaces",
  "body": " Topological spaces   The real numbers come equipped with a notion of nearness or closeness furnished by the absolute value function: namely, we define the distance between real numbers as . From this simple bit of structure springs all the fundamental concepts of real analysis: Cauchy sequences, limits, continuous functions, etc.  Topology can be seen as a vast generalization of this notion that abstracts away from the absolute value function, relying instead on the more abstract idea of open sets . Indeed, the notion of openness is introduced already in real analysis: a set is open if for all there is an such that if , then . Intuitively, you can think of this property as stating that has a certain roomy or generous nature: if , and is sufficiently close to , then has room for too. Come on in!  We view the the three conditions of as an attempt at axiomatizing this notion of openness (or roominess). This is the starting point of topology. The generality of this approach is part of topology's great power. We can define a notion of open sets on any set whatsoever: , we can choose a collection of subsets (called a topology ) that satisfies the axioms of . Furthermore, for a given set there are typically many distinct ways of making this choice; your topology on can be tailor-made to suit your particular needs. Beyond this generality and flexibility, the other key to topology's effectiveness is its ability to transport to any topological space the concepts of continuity, limits, connectedness, and compactness familiar to us from real analysis. Once a set is given the structure of a topological space, these notions can be used as powerful tools for investigating its properties. It is for this reason that topology plays an important role in essentially all mathematical fields: analysis, geometry, algebraic geometry, number theory, etc.    Topological space   A topological space is a pair , where is a set, and is a collection of subsets of satisfying the following axioms:   Trivial sets   and     Closed under arbitrary unions  Given any collection of elements , we have     Closed under finite intersections  If , then .   In this case we call a topology on , and an element is called an open set of . Although technically speaking a topological space is a pair , we often omit mention of the topology if there is no risk of confusion.     Equivalent alternative to axiom (3)   Using induction, we can show that if satisfies axiom (3) for any two elements of , then it satisfies it for any elements, for arbitrary. In other words if we replace axiom (3) with   (3')  If , then    , we get an equivalent definition of a toplogical space. When verifying whether a given is a topological space it may be more convenient to use axiom (3') as opposed to axiom (3).     Standard topology on   Let and define to be the set of open sets as defined above: that is, if and only if for all there is an such that the entire open interval is contained in . Show that is a topology on     We treat each axiom of in turn.   The empty set satisfies the defining property of trivially. Thus . For any , we have . Thus .    Assume for all , and let . We have . This shows satisfies the defining property of , and hence .    Assume , and let . We have . This shows that satisfies the defining property of , and hence that .        Trivial and discrete topology Let be a set.   The collection is a topology on , called the trivial topology . This is the topology on whose only open sets are the empty set and itself.    The collection is a topology on , called the discrete topology . This is the topology on for which every subset of is an open set.        Let . By definition the given contains and , and thus axiom (1) is satisfied. Since any union or intersection involving and is equal to either or , it is clear that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Thus axioms (2)-(3) are satisfied.    Let . By definition, is the set of all subsets of . In particular, it contains and , and thus axioms (1) is satisfied. Furthermore, since any union or intersection of subsets of is again a subset of , we see that axioms (2)-(3) are satisfied.        Some small topological spaces   For each set describe all subsets that satisfy the axioms of , and hence make a topological space.    Empty set       Singleton       Doubleton           When , we have . Since by axiom (1) a topology on must contain both and , we see the only option is . We showed that is always a topology on in . Thus is the unique choice of topology for . (Note: in this case the trivial and discrete topologies are equal.)    When , we have .

It follows that there are exactly four possibilities for based on whether the sets and are elements of : i.e., the only possibilities are . These are the four subsets of that satisfy axiom (1). It is now straightforward to show that each of these choices also satisfies axioms (2) and (3). Thus there are exactly 4 distinct topologies we can define on .       Cofinite topology  Let be a set. A subset is cofinite in if is finite. The collection of subsets is a topology, called the cofinite topology . In this topology a subset is open if and only if it is either empty or cofinite.

  "body": " Bases for topological spaces   When defining a topology for a set it is often convenient to specify instead a more manageable subset of that we can use to generate the entire topology using arbitrary unions and\/or finite intersections (our open set operators). A topological basis is a particularly nice example of this ( ) as the open sets of the topology it generates can be expressed as (arbitrary) unions of the basis elements. Bases will also provide a convenient way of comparing different topologies and (later on) determining whether relevant topological properties are satisfied by a given space.    Topological basis  Let be a set. A (topological) basis in is a collection of subsets of satisfying the following axioms:   Covers  For each there is a set such that .    Intersections covered by basis elements  If , then for all there is a such that .       Equivalent alternative to axiom (2)   Axiom (2) in is equivalent to saying that is equal to a union of elements of . In other words, we could replace (2) with the equivalent statement . This is a consequence of the more general fact expressed in .     Covering principle   Let be a collection of subsets of , and let . The following statements are equivalent.     for some sets . (In other words, is a union of elements of .)    For all there exists a set such that .       Implication:  Suppose for some sets . Given any we have for some . Since , we are done.    Implication:  By assumption, for all we can find a set such that . It follows that , showing that is a union of elements of .      Some bases for   Show that the given collections are bases in .                     It is clear that each collection of interval types covers in the sense of axiom (1). As for axiom (2), for each , , note that intersection of these types of intervals are either empty, or another interval of the same type. This is a result of the fact that , where the interval described on the right is understood to be the empty set if .     Topology generated by basis   Let be a basis in the set .    The set is a topology on .    We have the following alternate description of : .      Note: it is somewhat easier to show that is a topology using the description in statement (2), and then to show that the description in statement (1) is the same. (See Munkres for an approach like this.) I've decided to go the hard way since this is how I proceeded in class, and since it puts us through some useful set theory calisthenics!  First we show that as defined in (1) is a topology. We treat each axiom separately.    The empty set is the empty union of elements of ; thus . The covering axiom for bases implies that for all there is a such that . It follows that is a union of elements of , and thus that .    In plain English, a union of unions of elements of is a union of elements of . More rigorously, assume we have a collection of . By definition, for each we have , where for each . Thus , where is the set of all pairs of the form for and . Thus is a union of basis elements, and hence an element of .    It is enough to show that . (See .) Assume , , where for all . We have . Now by axiom (2') for bases (see ), each is a union of basis elements, and hence is an element . We have already shown that is closed under arbitrary unions. Thus is an element of .    This shows that , as defined in statement (1) of the theorem, is a topology. Statement (2) now follows from the general claim made in .     Topology generated by basis   Let be a basis in the set . The topology is called the topology generated by . Similarly, we call a basis for .     Comparing with bases   Let be a topology on generated by the basis .    Let be a topology on . We have .    Let be a topology on generated by the basis . We have .        Observe first that basis elements are open in the topology , essenitally by definition: , we have . The forward implication follows easily, since and implies .  Now consider the reverse implication . Assume . Given an open set we have for some by . Since for all (by assumption), and since is closed under arbitrary unions, we conclude . This proves , as desired.    This follows from and : the right-hand side of is simply an expansion of the right-hand side of , stating in more detail what it means for the basis element to be an element of the topology generated by .       A basis for the standard topology on   Show that the standard topology on  is topology generated by the basis in .    Let be the topology generated by and let be the standard topology on  . Since every open interval is open in each element of is an element of . By , we have . Next, assume ; then by definition for all there exists such that . It follows that , a union of elements of . Thus , by . This proves , and thus that , as desired.     Multiple bases for the standard real topology   Show that the bases from both generate the standard topology on .    Let be the topology generated by , . We must show that and . Clearly any is an element of , and hence an element of . It follows from that . Next, take any . Since the rational numbers are dense in , for any we can find satisfying . From it follows that .     Lower limit topology  The collection is called the lower limit basis , and the topology it generates is called the lower limit topology on . We denote the topological space as .    Lower limit is finer than standard   Show that the lower limit topology on is strictly finer than the standard one.    Let be the Euclidean and lower limit topologies, respectively. According to , to show we must show that for any basis element and any , there is a basis element satisfying . Since , we have , and thus we have , as desired.  To show is strictly finer than it suffices to find a basis element that cannot be written as a union of basis elements of . Consider the half-open interval . To show this is not a union of open intervals it is enough to show that for the element there is no open interval satisfying . This is clear since any interval containing must also contain negative numbers, and hence cannot be a subset of .     -topology  Let , and define . The collection is a basis in . The topology it generates is called the -topology on . We denote the topological space as .   We show that is a basis, treating each axiom separately.   Since by definition contains all finite open intervals, it clearly covers .    We claim that in fact given , their intersection is either empty or another element of . Axiom (2) follows directly from this claim.  Why is the claim true? An element of is either of the form or , where is an open interval. There are then three different cases describing intersections of two elements, as shown below. Here denote finite open intervals. . As we have already remarked, is either empty or a finite open interval . The claim now follows easily.        Comparing standard, lower limit, and -topology     Show that the -topology is strictly finer than the standard topology on .    Show that the lower limit topology and -topology are incomparable.      Let be the Euclidean, lower limit, and -topologies, respectively.    By definition, the basis for the -topology contains all finite open intervals. It follows from that . Next, using an argument similar to the one in , we show that the basis element cannot be covered by open intervals . Indeed, consider the element . Any open interval containing must contain an element of the form for some positive integer . Since , it follows that . We conclude that is not covered by open intervals .    This is left as an exercise.       Basis criterion   Let be a topology on the set . A subset is a basis of if and only if for all and there is an element such that .    We prove both implications of the given if and only if statement separately.   Case:  Assume is generated by . According to the description of in , for all and there is an element such that .    Case:  Assume for that for all and there is an element such that . Taking we see in particular that for all there is a such that . Thus satisfies axiom (1) for a basis. Next, let and take . Since are open, so is . Our assumption now implies that there is a such that . Thus axiom (2) of holds, and we condlude is a basis.      Bases for discrete topology   Let be a set, and let be the discrete topology on . Show the following:    is a basis for .    If is a basis for , then . In other words, is the minimal basis of the discrete topology.       This is left as an exercise.      "

These types of spaces are pervasive throughout mathematics and are conceptually very familiar or intuitive. Indeed, historically metric spaces were the main inspiration to axiomatic topology; and the metric balls defined in were the inspiration for the notion of a topological basis. Lastly, the defining structure of metric space, a metric  , gives us a quantitative grip on the topology, wheareas generally in topology we must rely on the qualitative description of open sets given by the axioms.    Metric space  A metric space is a pair , where is a set and is a function satisfying the following axioms:   Positivity   , and if and only if , for all .    Symmetry   for all .    Triangle inequality   for all .   The function is called a metric or a distance function on , and for any we call the distance between  and .    metric Euclidean  metric box  metric taxicab  Euclidean, box, and taxicab metrics   Let , where is a positive integer. Let .   Euclidean metric  The function defined as is a metric, called the Euclidean metric . The metric space is called Euclidean -space . The norm of , denoted , is defined as .    Box metric  The function defined as is a metric, called the box metric (or square metric ).    Taxicab metric  The function defined as is a metric, called the taxicab metric .          It is easiest to prove that the Euclidean metric is indeed a metric by first expressing it in terms of the dot product as and then using well-known properties of the dot product, including the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.    Let be the box metric. It is clear that for all . Furthermore, we have . This proves positivity. The symmetry follows easily from the fact that . As for the triangle inequality, for all we have , where the leftmost inequality is the triangle inequality for the absolute value, and the rightmost inequality follows from the definition of . Since the inequality holds for all , we conclude that .    This is a homework exercise.        Metric balls   Let be a metric space. Given and the -ball centered at is the subset defined as . In other words, is the set of all elements of lying within a distance of of . We call the radius of . More generally, we call a subset a -metric ball if for some and .

Metric balls for Euclidean and box metrics   Describe the metric balls for the Euclidean and box metrics on for .    For the two metrics are just , the same one we used to define the standard topology on . Epsilon balls here are just intervals of the form .  For the Euclidean distance defined is the standard distance between two points in or . The set of points satisfying is thus the circle of radius centered at for , and the sphere of radius centered at for . It follows that an -ball is the interior of the this circle or sphere, respectively.  True to its name, an -ball around is the open -cube . (Note that the product here is the Cartesian product of these intervals. (See .)) Indeed, we have .     Metric balls   Let be a metric ball in the metric space . If , there is a such that . In other words, for all elements of a metric ball , we can find a metric ball centered at contained in .    Since , we have and hence . We claim that . Indeed, we have . It follows that , proving .     Metric spaces  Let be a metric space. The set of all metric balls is a topological basis, giving the structure of a topological space. We say the topology generated by the topology is induced by the metric .  With respect to this topology we have .   We must prove (1) that is a basis, and (2) that the description of openness in ( ) is correct. (The description in ( ) follows directly from ( ).)    For all , we have , proving the first axiom of . Next, let be two metric balls. Given , there are such that for . Setting , we have . This proves the second axiom.    Using the alternate description ( of the topology generated by a basis we have .       Comparing metric topologies   Let be two metrics on the set , and let be the topologies they induce.   We have if and only if every -metric ball is a union of -metric balls.    We have if and only if every -metric ball is a union of -metric balls and every -metric ball is a union of -metric balls.       Both statements follow directly from .     Equivalence of Euclidean, box, and taxicab metrics   Let . Show that the Euclidean, box, and taxicab metrics all induce the same topology on .    We adjust our notation to accommodate for different metrics at play simultaneously. Let , , be the three metrics in question, and let , , be their respective topologies. We will denote -balls with respect to each as , , .  We will show and , from whence it follows that .   Case:  For any nonnegative numbers we have . From this it follows that for any and any we have , showing that within any Euclidean metric ball centered at we can find a box metric ball centered at , and vice versa. Now given any element in a Euclidean metric ball , there is a Euclidean metric ball centered at contained in by . By there is box metric ball centered at satisfying . Using our covering principle , we conclude that any Euclidean metric ball is covered by box metric balls, and thus . A very similar argument, using the other inclusion of , shows that .    Case:  For any nonnegative we have , from whence it follows that for any and we have . An argument exactly like the one from the previous case now shows .       Given a set the function defined as is a metric on , called the trivial metric .    The proof that is a metric is left as an exercise.     Trivial metric   Determine the topology induced on a set by the trivial metric.    This example is left as an exercise.     -adic metric   Let be the set of integers. Let be the set of prime integers. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that any nonzero integer can be factored in unique was as a product of primes in the form , where is a nonnegative integer, and for all but finitely many primes . We call the valuation of at the prime ; it tells us the highest power of dividing .  Now fix a prime integer . For we define its -adic norm  as . The function defined as is a metric on , called the -adic metric. Integers are close to one another with respect to this metric if their difference is highly divisible by .    We content ourselves with a proof sketch in order to avoid getting into the weeds of elementary number theory. The positivity and symmetry axioms follow readily from simple properties of divisibility. For the triangle inequality it is enough to prove that the -adic norm satisfies the triangle inequality on : , for all we have since then for any we have . Lastly, the inequality follows from the stronger claim , which itself follows from divisibility properties.    "

The -axiom   A topological space is (or is a -space , or satisfies the -axiom ) if all finite subsets of are closed.     as separation axiom  The is called a separation axiom , or Trennungsaxiom in German: hence the T . To see more explicitly why this is called a separation axiom, note that (a) is equivalent to the property that any singleton is closed, and (b) this in turn is equivalent to saying for any two elements there is an open neighborhood of that does not contain ; we think of this as separating and .  We will say more about separation axioms later. For now, I'll mention that the Hausdorff property is itself a separation axiom, called the -axiom.    Hausdorff versus   Let be a topological space.    If is Hausdorff, then is     It is not the case that if is , then must be Hausdorff.    Using logical shorthand, we have     Statement (1) follows from .  We provide a counterexample to the claim that implies Hausdorff. Let be any infinite set endowed with the cofinite topology. The closed sets of are precisely the finite sets and itself, as we saw in . Thus is . On the other hand, is not Hausdorff. Indeed take any two distinct elements .

Given any , we have . The open balls are disjoint open neighrborhoods of and , respectively.    Let be an infinite set with the cofinite topology. We will show that is not Hausdorff and hence not a metric space. In fact, we will show that any two nonempty open sets in intersect nontrivially. Indeed, given nonempty open sets , we have by definition , for finite sets . Their intersection is the open set Since is infinite and the are finite, we have , and thus .

In particular, we see in the context of the spaces and that different topologies on these product sets give rise to different and valuable notions of function convergence for real-valued functions.    Pointwise convergence   Let be a collection of topological spaces, let , and let be a sequence of elements of : , using tuple notation, for each we have , where . The sequence  converges pointwise to an element if for all we have : , .     Pointwise convergence   Observe that the definition of pointwise convergence makes no reference to any topology on . Below we investigate how it relates to convergence in the box and product topologies.     Sequences in and   Our understanding of tuples in product spaces as functions pays real dividends when investigating convergence of sequences in these spaces.  For example, if a tuple in is just a function , the graph of which in the real plane is easily visualized: namely, a discrete collection of plotted points for .  Similarly, a tuple in is just a function , which is easily visualized via a graph.  In both cases, sequences of tuples are easily visualized as sequences of functions (via their graphs). Furthermore, for the sequence to converge pointwise pointwise at a given index ( for , and for ) is simply for the sequence of values to converge.     Pointwise convergence and product topology   Let be a collection of topologies, let be their product, and let be a sequence of elements of .    If in the box or product topology, then converges to pointwise.    In the product topology we have .         Suppose in either topology. Fix and let be any open set containing . The set is an open neighborhood of in both topologies. By convergence there is an such that for all . It follows that for all . This proves that for all .    Suppose the sequence converges to pointwise. To show in the product topology it is enough to show that for any base open set of the form there is an such that if , then . Since converges to pointwise, for each , there is an such that if , then . Setting , it follows that if then for . Since for all we conclude that for all , as desired.        Convergent sequences in   Let , where is equipped with the standard topology, and let be the sequence defined as for all .    Visualize the sequence in the real plane.    Decide whether the sequence converges pointwise. If so, what does it converge to?    Decide whether the sequence converges in the product topology, and whether it converges in the box topology.      It is relatively easy to see that the sequence converges pointwise to . Since with the standard topology is Hausdorff, it follows that this pointwise limit is unique. By , also converges in the product topology to . We claim does not converge at all in the box topology. First observe, that the only candidate for the limit of this convergence is , using (1) of .

  "body": " Homeomorphisms   Consider the two spaces and , both equipped with the discrete topology. As sets they are clearly not equal; and yet considered as topological spaces they are essentially the same. Indeed, we call both spaces the discrete topological space on a set of two elements. The notion of a homeomorphism gives us a rigorous way of determining when two spaces are essentially the same thing, topologically speaking .    Homeomorphism   Let and be topological spaces. A function is a homeomorphism if the following conditions are satisfied:    is continuous;     is invertible (equivalently, is bijective);    the inverse function is continuous.   Two spaces are homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism between them.     Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous   You may have met analogs of the homeomorphism in other areas of mathematics: , in linear algebra or group theory. In category theory it is what is called an isomorphism . The basic idea is that once you decide what the structure-preserving maps are between objects (continuous functions for topological spaces, linear transformations for vector spaces, homomorphisms for groups), an isomorphism is essentially just an invertible structure-preserving map: a vector space isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation; a group isomorphism is an invertible group homomorphism. The only subtlety is that you want the inverse of this invertible function to also be structure preserving! For linear transformations and group homomorphisms this is automatic. Not so for continuous functions! The inverse of an invertible continuous function need not be continuous, as the example below illustrates.     Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous   Let and be the spaces obtained by equipping with the standard and discrete topologies, respectively. The identity function is clearly continuous and invertible. In fact, we have . However, is not continuous. Indeed, is open in , but is not open in . Thus is an invertible continuous function that is not a homeomorphism.     Homeomorphic equivalence relation   For topological spaces , define the relation to mean is homeomorphic to . This relation is an equivalence relation. That is, for all topological spaces we have . These three properties follow from the simple facts that (1) the identity map is a homeomorphism, (2) the inverse of a homeomorphism is a homeomomoprhism, (3) the composition of homeomorphisms is a homeomorphism.     All open intervals of are homeomorphic   In the following, all intervals are treated as metric spaces with the Euclidean metric on . Make use of any function whose continuity properties are well known.    Prove that any finite open interval is homeomorphic to .    Prove that and are homeomorphic.    Prove that and are both homeomorphic to .    Explain why we may now conclude that all open intervals of are homeomorphic.        The function defined as is linear (hence continuous) and has continuous inverse .    The function is continuous and has continuous inverse .    The functions , , and , are continuous and have continuous inverses and .    This is now the result of the fact that being homeomorphic is an equivalence relation. In more detail, from (1) we know that all finite open intervals are homeomorphic; this in conjunction with (2) shows that all finite open intervals are homemorphic to . From (3) we conclude that all half-finite intervals are homeomorphic to . Since any open interval is either finite, half-finite, or equal to , we conclude that all open intervals are homeomorphic.       Universal property of product space   Let be a collection of topological spaces, and let equipped with the product topology. Let be the -th projection map.    Product mapping property  Given any topological space and any collection of continuous maps , there is a unique continuous map satisfying for all .  In other words, specifying a continuous map into the product space is equivalent to specifying continuous maps into for all     Unique up to homeomorphism  If is any other topological space equipped with continuous maps , and if the product mapping property (1) is satisfied with replacing and replacing , then is homeomorphic to .  In other words, up to homeomorphism, the mapping property uniquely characterizes the product space.        First observe that equality for elements in can be express in terms of the projection maps as follows: . Using this fact, we see that given a function we have . Thus the function is the unique function from to satisfying for all . To see that this is continuous, we show that is open for any base open set . For such a we have for some open sets , . By definition of we have if and only if if and only if for all . Thus . Since each is continuous, we conclude that is open for all , and hence is open.    Let together with continuous maps be any other space that satisfies the product mapping property (1). By (1) (taking ) there is a continuous function satisfying . Similarly, since also satisfies the product mapping property, we have (now taking in (1)) a continuous map satisfying . I claim and : , is a continuous inverse of , and thus is a homeomorphism between and .  To see why we use the uniqueness claim in the product mapping property (twice). Indeed, the function is continuous and satisfies for all . But the function also satisfies for all . By the uniqueness claim of the product mapping property, we conclude , as desired. The proof that is nearly identical, now applying the product mapping propery to maps into .       Open and closed maps   Let be a function between topological spaces.    is open if for all open we have open in .     is closed if for all closed we have closed in .        Homeomorphism equivalences   Let be a function between topological spaces. The following statements are equivalent.    is a homeomorphism.     is continuous, invertible, and open.     is continuous, invertible, and closed.      Assume is continous and invertible throughout. To be a homeomorphism we need to be continuous. Since if and only if , we see that . Thus continuous if and only if is open for all open , if and only if is open for all open , if and only if is open. The same argument with closed replacing open shows is continuous if and only if is closed. The equivalence of (1)-(3) now follows.    Open and closed maps   Don't be mislead by into thinking that being an open continuous map is equivalent to being a closed continuous map; we need the additional assumption of invertibility to guarantee equivalence. As an example, consider any constant function from to itself: this is clearly continuous and closed, but not open.     Topological properties   Let be a property that is either satisfied or not satisfied by any given topological space. We say is a topological property if it is invariant under homeomorphisms: , if and are homeomorphic, then satisfies if and only if satisfies .     Topological properties   It is easy to see that the properties of being discrete, , Hausdorff, or a metric space are topological.     Continuous bijection onto circle   Let and , and equip each set with the subspace topology inherited from (resp. ) with its Euclidean topology.  Prove: the function defined as is continuous and invertible, but not a homeomorphism.    Recall first that on the product topology, Euclidean metric topology, and box topology are all equal. Since and are continuous, it follows from that the map is continuous. Next, since , where , it follows that is continuous: indeed, for any open set , we have for some open , and , which is open since is continuous.  The usual trigonometric arguments show that is injective and surjective. However, is not open, and hence not a homeomorphism. Indeed, let , which is open in . The image is easily seen to be the upper half of the circle minus the point : in particular, all points have nonnegative -coordinates. On the other hand, we have and with respect to the subspace topology on any open set containing contains elements of whose -coordinate is negative. It follows that is not open.    In light of , it is natural to ask whether given topological spaces there is a space with continuous maps that satisfies a dual mapping property to that of the product. Indeed, there is, and we call it the coproduct of the .   Coproduct space  Let be a collection of topological spaces, let be the disjoint union of the , and let be the the inclusion maps identifying each with a subset of . The coproduct topology on is the topology generated by the basis defined as follows: . We call together with the topology the coproduct topology of the . With respect to this topology, each injection is continuous.    Universal property of coproduct space   Let be a collection of topological spaces, and let be their coproduct. For each let be the inclusion map identifying with a subset of .    Coproduct mapping property  Given any topological space and any collection of continuous maps , there is a unique continuous map satisfying for all .

In category theory it is what is called an isomorphism . The basic idea is that once you decide what the structure-preserving maps are between objects (continuous functions for topological spaces, linear transformations for vector spaces, homomorphisms for groups), an isomorphism is essentially just an invertible structure-preserving map: a vector space isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation; a group isomorphism is an invertible group homomorphism. The only subtlety is that you want the inverse of this invertible function to also be structure preserving! For linear transformations and group homomorphisms this is automatic. Not so for continuous functions! The inverse of an invertible continuous function need not be continuous, as the example below illustrates.   "

Regular and normal spaces   Let be a topological space.    is regular if is , and given any closed set and any , the sets and can be separated by open sets.     is normal if is , and any two disjoint closed sets of can be separated by open sets.        Separation axioms  The properties of being , Hausdorff, regular, or normal are called separation axioms as they articulate how various subsets can be separated by open sets. Below you find the descriptions of these properties using the Trennungsaxiom schema. A further remark about the use of regular and normal in the literature: some texts do not include the condition in these notions, and describe the properties we define as regular Hausdorff and normal regular . There is considerably less ambiguity in the literature when using the descriptions, but you should still be careful.    Trennungsaxiom implications  It is easy to see that . Furthermore, your argument for the first two implications will reveal why the condition is needed.    Elementary examples      Discrete spaces are regular and normal.    An infinite space with the cofinite topology is neither regular nor normal.       (1) is clear since all sets are both open and closed. (2) follows from the fact that in this space any two nonempty open sets intersect nontrivially.     Metric spaces are normal   If is a metric space, then is normal.    Let be disjoint closed subsets of . For each we can find an such that . Similarly for each we can find an such that . I claim the open sets are disjoint, proving and are separated by open sets. Indeed if , then for some and . Without loss of generality we may assume that . But then we would have . This is a contradiction since we assumed .     is not regular   Prove: is Hausdorff, but not regular.    Since the -topology is finer than the standard topology on , is Hausdorff. To see that it is not regular, recall that is closed. I'll show that we cannot separate 0 and with open sets. Indeed, suppose we have open disjoint sets containing respectively. Since is open, it must contain an open basis element $B$ containing ; and since , this basis element can be chosen of the form . Now choose such that . Since we can find a basis element of the form that is contained in . Furthermore, shrinking if necessary, we can assume that . But then clearly , and hence also . Contradiction!     Regular and normal equivalences   Let be a -space.    is regular if and only if for all and open set , there is an open set such that .     is normal if and only if for any closed set and open set containing , there is an open set containing satisfying .          First, assume is regular. Given and as described, we can separate and the closed set by open sets and . It follows that : indeed, given any , the open set contains and does not intersect with .  Conversely, assume for all and open sets we can find an open set satisfying . Given any closed set and element , letting , we see that there is an open set satisfying . The open sets and are then easily seen to separate and .    This proof is very similar to the last. Essenially you need only replace with a closed set throughout.        Locally compact implies regular   Let be locally compact and Hausdorff. Prove: is regular.    This is an easy consequence of and .     Locally compact and non-normal  Yes, there are examples of locally compact -spaces that are not normal. They are not particularly easy to build, however. Look it up!    is regular   Prove: is regular.    Since has a finer topology than , it is . We will use the equivalence (1) from . Given any and open set , we can find such that . But is closed! (Prove this.) Thus we have found an open containing such that .     Basis of clopen sets  The argument from is easily generalized to show that any -space that has a basis consisting of sets that are both open and closed ( , clopen sets) is regular.    Regularity: subspace and product properties      Subspaces of regular spaces are regular.    Products of regular spaces are regular.          Assume is a subspace of the regular space . We know already that subspaces of -spaces are , so is . Next take any and any set not containing that is closed in . We have for some closed set . Since and is regular, we can find disjoint open sets that separate and in . The disjoint open (in ) sets and are then a separation of and in .    We use (1) from . Given and open set containing , choose a basis element of the form containing . Since each is regular, we can find open sets satisfying . Letting , we have .        Interestingly, neither of the statements of are true if regular is replaced with normal . It is worthwhile to examine what goes wrong in our arguments above if the element is replaced with a closed set throughout.   "

The following statements are equivalent.    is compact.    Every net in has a limit point.    Every net in has a convergent subnet.       Statements (ii) and (iii) are immediately seen to be equivalent thanks to . We will show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent.   Implication: (i) (ii)  Let be a net in . For each define . Clearly each is closed and nonempty. Furthermore, for any finite collection we have , since we can find a such that for all , and hence . Since is assumed to be compact, there is an element . We show that is a limit point of . Indeed, given any open set containing and any , since , there is an element with such that . This proves that is cofinally in , as desired.    Implication: (ii) (i)  We prove the contrapositive. Suppose is not compact, and let be a cover with no finite cover. Define to the be the set of all pairs , where is a finite subset of and . (Note that since has no finite subcover.) It is easy to see that is a directed set under the quasiordering defined as if and only if . Define the net as . We show that has no limit point. To this end, given any , we have for some . We will show that the net is not cofinally in . To this end consider the index , where . For all with , we have , in which case . Thus there is no satisfying .       Tychonoff's theorem   We now give a proof of Tychonoff's theorem using nets. The first such proof was given by UC Berkeley mathematician John L. Kelley in his 1950 paper Convergence in topology . Our proof draws from a couple of slight improvements to Kelley's original argument, both proffered by additional UC Berkeley mathematicians. (Go Bears!) Paul Chernoff's A simple proof of Tychonoff's theorem via nets removed the need for universal nets in Kelley's argument; Charles Pugh is credited for , which removes the argument's reliance on subnets. All of these various proofs invoke Zorn's lemma , which as it turns out is equivalent to the axiom of choice. You may be asking: Is there a proof of the Tychonoff theorem that does not rely on the axiom of choice? Amazingly, the answer is no! In fact, Kelley himself proved that Tychonoff's theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice in another paper from 1950: The Tychonoff product theorem implies the axiom of choice . His argument is simply too elegant not to include here. (Note: Kelley's original argument had a minor flaw that is corrected in the proof below. I encourage you to look at the original article and see if you can find the invalid step.)    Tychonoff implies AC (Kelley)   If Tychonoff's theorem is true, then the axiom of choice is true.    Assume Tychonoff's theorem is true. We will prove the following equivalent formulation of the axiom of choice: . Given a collection of nonempty sets, let the result of adding one additional point, , to each . Why do we do this? Add the marked point to the -th component space gives us a foothold, as it were, allowing us to find elements in the product without invoking the axiom of choice in the process: we can always choose the -th entry to be this special element . We will use Tychonoff's theorem to show that is a nonempty subset of . To do so, we need to give the sets a compact topological structure: this is accomplished by declaring the topology on to be . (Check that this is a topology.) This clearly makes compact, since only contains four open sets. Note also that is closed with respect to this topology.  Since each is compact, by Tychonoff's theorem so is . For each , let be the th projection map and define . Since is closed in , and since is continuous, the set is closed for each . Furthermore given any finite set , the set is nonempty: indeed, by the finite axiom of choice principle (which is implied by ZF set theory) there exists a tuple , and thus the element defined as is an element of . Now since is compact, we have , using the finite intersection characterization of compactness. But clearly . Thus .    Now on to a net-based proof of Tychonoff's theorem. As mentioned we use Zorn's lemma, the statement of which involves some extra jargon.   Upper bounds, maximal elements, chains   Let be a partially ordered set.  An upper bound on a subset is an element such that for all .  An element is maximal if given any , if , then .  A subset is a chain (or totally ordered ) if for all we have or .     Zorn's lemma   Let be a partially ordered set. If every chain has an upper bound, then has a maximal element: , there is an such that for all , if , then .    As stated above, Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice. You can find a proof of this fact in most introductory set theory texts.    Lastly, before moving to the main attraction, we record a useful lemma that will simplify our main argument. The proof idea, due to Charles Pugh, avoids all mention of subnets, providing a path to proving Tychonoff's theorem that does not require subnets. There is a fairly direct alternative proof of the lemma using convergent subnets. See if you can figure it out!   Nets in products   Let be topological spaces, and assume is compact. Let be a net in , and let be the projection onto map. If is a limit point of the net , then there is a such that is a limit point of .    Let be a limit point of . Define to be the set of all pairs , where is an open neighborhood of , and . For elements we declare if and only if and . It is easy to see that is a partially ordered set with respect to this ordering. To see that it is directed, given indices and in , since is a limit point of , we can find a where and . This satisfies and , as desired.  Now define the net as . (Recall, our original net is .) Since is compact, the net has a limit point . We claim that is a limit point of our original net . To prove this, it is enough to show that given any basic opens set containing , and any , we can find an index such that . Given containing and index , first pick an index such that . This is possible since is a limit point of . By definition the pair is an element of . Since is a limit point of the net , and since is an open neighborhood of , we can find an element such that and . By definition of and its partial ordering, we have , , and . We conclude that , as desired.     Tychonoff theorem   Given any collection of compact spaces the product space is compact.    Proof (following P. Chernoff)  We show that any net in has a limit point . In an effort to distinguish between the different types of tuple objects at play here, I will exclusively use tuple notation for nets and exclusively use function notation for elements of . This is already in force above: the net specifies an element for each index ; but each is itself a function satisfying .  Now define to be the set of all pairs , where and is a limit point of the net . Note how we are exploiting the function notation here: since elements of are just functions with domain , restricting the domain yields a map from to defined as . This map is in fact just the projection map defined as . It follows from this that this map is continuous.  Next, we define the relation on as follows: if and only if and . It is easy to see that is a partial ordering. We now proceed in two steps: (1) we will show that satisfies the conditions of Zorn's lemma, and hence that it has a maximal element ; (2) we will show that and hence that is a limit point of . It then follows that is compact, as desired.   Step 1: has a maximal element  First observe that is nonempty. Indeed, given any , the net is just a net in the compact space , and hence has a limit point . It follows that . (There is a slight subtlety here, which is that the space is homeomorphic to the (somewhat funny looking) product space via the map .)  Next we show that any chain in has an upper bound in . To this end, given any chain in , we define as follows:    ;    the function is defined as , where is any element of for which .   First observe that is a well-defined function: if , where , then since is a chain either or ; assuming without loss of generality that we have by definition, and hence that . Next we must show that , understood as an element of , is a limit point of the net . Using the usual product topology basis, it suffices to show that given any finite set and open set of the form , and given any , there is an such that . Since is finite, we have for some sets satisfying . Since is a chain, there is an index such that for all . Thus we may assume there is an element such that . By definition is a limit point of the net . Since , it follows that . Thus there is an such that . It follows easily that . This proves is a limit point of , and hence that . It is clear from the definition of , that it is an upper bound of .  Having shown that satisfies the chain condition for Zorn's lemma, we conclude that it contains a maximal element .    Step 2:  Let be a maximal element of , so that is a limit point of the net . We show that and hence that is a limit point of .  Assume by contradiction that , and let . Since is compact, by the net in has a limit point of the form . But then the element defined as and satisfies and , contradicting the fact that is a maximal element.       "

Add the marked point to the -th component space gives us a foothold, as it were, allowing us to find elements in the product without invoking the axiom of choice in the process: we can always choose the -th entry to be this special element . We will use Tychonoff's theorem to show that is a nonempty subset of . To do so, we need to give the sets a compact topological structure: this is accomplished by declaring the topology on to be .

Since each is compact, by Tychonoff's theorem so is . For each , let be the th projection map and define . Since is closed in , and since is continuous, the set is closed for each .
