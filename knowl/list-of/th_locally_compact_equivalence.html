(See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/th_compact_Haus_closed.html" title="Theorem 1.14.7: Compact implies closed in Hausdorff spaces">TheoremÂ 1.14.7</a>.)

To show <span class="process-math">\(\overline{V}\subseteq U\text{,}\)</span> it suffices to show that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{V}\cap C=K-U\)</span> is empty.
