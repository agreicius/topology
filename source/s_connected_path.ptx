      A <term>path</term> in (or to) a topological space <m>X</m> is a continuous function <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m>, where <m>[a,b]\subseteq \R</m> is a closed interval. We call <m>f(a)=x</m> the <term>start point</term> (or <term>initial point</term>) and <m>f(b)=x'</m> the <term>end point</term> (or <term>terminal point</term>) of the path <m>f</m>.

Two elements <m>x, x'\in X</m> are <term>connected by a path in <m>X</m></term> if there is a path <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m> such that <m>f(a)=x</m> and <m>f(b)=x'</m>.

  <title>Path-connected implies connected</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>X</m> is path connected, then <m>X</m> is connected. Using logical shorthand:
      <me>
        X \text{ path connected}\implies X \text{ connected}.

    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume by contradiction that <m>X=U_1\cup U_2</m> is a separation of <m>X</m>. We can find points <m>x_1\in U_1, x_2\in U_2</m>. Let <m>f\colon [a,b]\rightarrow X</m> be a path connecting <m>x, x'</m>. By <xref ref="th_connected_continuous"/>, the image <m>f([a.b])</m> is connected. By <xref ref="th_connected_subspace"/> we must have <m>f([a,b])\subseteq U_1</m> or <m>f([a,b])\subseteq U_2</m>. This contradicts the fact that <m>f(a)=x_1\in U_1, f(b)=x_2\in U_2</m>
      and <m>U_1\cap U_2=\emptyset</m>. Thus there can be no separation of <m>X</m>, and we conclude that it is connected.

  <title>Balls in <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=\R^n</m> be Euclidean <m>n</m>-space. For all <m>\epsilon &gt;0</m> and any <m>\boldx\in \R^n</m>, the open ball <m>B_\epsilon(\boldx)</m> is connected, as is the closed ball <m>\overline{B}_\epsilon(\boldx)</m> defined as
      <me>
        \overline{B}_{\epsilon}(\boldx)=\{\boldy\colon d(\boldy,\boldx)\leq \epsilon\}.
      </me>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      It is easy to see that the straight line path <m>\phi\colon[0,1]\rightarrow \R^n</m> defined as <m>\phi(t)=(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy</m> is a continuous function connecting any two points in <m>\R^n</m>. For our current purposes, we wish to show that if <m>\boldy\in B_{\epsilon}(\boldx)</m>, then so is <m>(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy</m>, for any <m>t\in [0,1]</m>. To this end, note that 
      <md>
        <mrow>d(\phi(t),\boldx)\amp =\norm{(1-t)\boldx+t\boldy-\boldx}  </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\norm{t(\boldy-\boldx)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\abs{t}d(\boldy,\boldx)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp \leq \epsilon \amp (0\leq t\leq 1)</mrow>     
      </md>.
      This proves that the open ball is path connected, and hence connected. Next, it is easy to see that the closed ball is in fact the closure of the open ball. Since connectedness is preserved under closure, we conclude that the closed ball is connected.

  <title>Punctured Euclidean space <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>: <m>n\geq 2</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
        Let <m>X=\R^n</m> be Euclidean <m>n</m>-space, where <m>n\geq 2</m>. The subspace <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> is connected.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Take any <m>\boldx,\boldy\in \R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>. If the two vectors are not scalar multiples of one another, then the straight line path connecting them is guaranteed to lie in <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m>, using a linear independence argument. If <m>\boldy=c\boldx</m>, then since <m>\dim \R^n\geq 2</m>, we can find a vector <m>\boldz\in \R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> that is not a scalar multiple of either vector. We can then construct a polygonal path lieing in <m>\R^n-\{\boldzero\}</m> that first connects <m>\boldx</m> to <m>\boldz</m> via a straight line path, and then connects <m>\boldz</m> to <m>\boldy</m> via a straight line path.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Prove: if <m>n\geq 2</m>, then there is no homeomorphism from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R^n</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Assume by contradiction that <m>\phi\colon \R\rightarrow \R^n</m> is a homeomorphism for some <m>n\geq 2</m>. It follows that the restriction <m>\phi\colon \R-\{0\}\rightarrow \R^n-\{\phi(0)\}</m> is a homeomorphism. This a contradiction since <m>\R-\{0\}</m> is not connected (<m>(0,\infty)</m> is open and closed in <m>\R-\{0\}</m>), but <m>\R^n-\{\phi(0)\}</m> is connected.

  <title>The <m>n</m>-sphere</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Fix <m>n\geq 1</m>. The <m>n</m>-sphere <m>S^n</m> is defined as
      <me>
        S^n=\{\boldx\in \R^{n+1}\colon \norm{\boldx}=1\}=\{(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_{n+1})\colon \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots +x_{n+1}^2}=1\}
      </me>.
      Prove: <m>S^n</m> is connected for all <m>n\geq 1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Fix <m>n\geq 1</m> and consider the map <m>\phi\colon \R^{n+1}-\{\boldzero\}\rightarrow S^n</m> defined as <m>\phi(\boldx)=\frac{\boldx}{\norm{\boldx}}</m>, where as usual 
      <me>
        \norm{(x_1,x_2,\dots, x_{n+1})}=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots +x_{n+1}^2}
      </me>.
      This map is continuous (homework exercise!) and surjective. Since <m>\R^{n+1}-\{\boldzero\}</m> is connected, we see that <m>S^n</m> is the image of a connected set under a continuous function, hence connected.

          The set <m>X</m> is not path connected. More specifically, we can show that <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(1,\sin(1))</m> are not connected by a path in <m>X</m>.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>(0,1]</m> is connected and <m>f\colon (0,1]\rightarrow \R</m> is continuous, its graph <m>\Gamma_f</m> is connected by <xref ref="cor_graph_connected"/>. Since closure preserves connectedness, we conclude that <m>X=\overline{\Gamma_f}</m> is connected.

            Suppose <m>\phi\colon [0,1]\rightarrow X</m> is a path connecting <m>(0,0)</m> and <m>(1,\sin(1)</m>. We can write <m>\phi(t)=(\alpha(t), \beta(t))</m> where the component functions <m>x=\alpha(t), y=\beta(t)</m> are both continuous. The set <m>C=\{t\colon \alpha(t)=0\}=\alpha^{-1}(\{0\})\subseteq [0,1]</m> is closed, since <m>\alpha</m> is continuous. Set <m>t_0=\sup C=\max C</m> (guaranteed to exist since <m>C\subseteq[0,1]</m> is closed), and let <m>\phi(t_0)=(0,y_0)</m>. Note that <m>t_0\ne 1</m> since <m>\phi(1)=(1,\sin 1)</m>, and that for all <m>t&gt; t_0</m> we have <m>\phi(t)\in \Gamma_t</m> and hence <m>y=\beta(t)=f(\alpha(t))</m>. Take <m>\epsilon=1</m>. We will show that there is no <m>\delta</m>-ball around <m>t_0</m> such that <m>\beta(B_\delta(t_0))\subseteq B_{1}(y_0)</m>, contradicting the continuity of <m>\beta</m>.

          <p>
            For any any <m>\delta&gt; 0</m>, <m>\alpha([t_0, t_0+\delta))</m> is an interval since <m>\alpha(t)</m> is continuous and <m>[t_0,t_0+\delta)</m> is connected. This means that <m>\alpha([t_0,t_0+\delta))</m> contains an interval of the form <m>[0,c)</m> for some <m>c>0</m>. Due to the highly oscillatory nature of <m>f</m>, we can find points <m>x_1,x_2\in [0,c)</m> satisfying <m>f(x_1)=1, f(x_2)=-1</m>. Since these points are in the image of <m>\alpha</m>, we have <m>x_1=\alpha(t_1)</m> and <m>x_2=\alpha(t_2)</m> for some <m>t_1,t_2\in (t_0,t_0+\delta)</m>. But then

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let us prove that <m>C(x)</m> is maximally connected. It is connected as it is the union of connected sets containing <m>x</m>. If <m>C(x)\subseteq A</m> and <m>A</m> is connected, then since <m>x\in A</m>, we have by definition <m>A\subseteq C(x)</m>. Thus <m>C(x)</m> is maximally connected. Lastly, if <m>A</m> is a maximally connected set containing <m>x</m>, then by definition we have <m>A\subseteq C(x)</m>; and since <m>A</m> is maximally connected we conclude that <m>A=C(x)</m>. This proves <m>C(x)</m> is the <em>unique</em> maximally connected set containing <m>x</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The proof that <m>C_p(x)</m> is the unique maximally path-connected set containing <m>x</m> proceeds in exactly the same manner. We use the fact (not made official, but easy to show) that a union of path-path connected sets with a common intersection point is path connected.   
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It is clear that <m>X=\bigcup_{x\in X}C(x)</m>, since <m>x\in C(x)</m> for all <m>x\in X</m>. Furthermore, we know <m>C(x)</m> is maximally connected by <m>(1)</m>. Since <m>\overline{C(x)}</m> is connected and <m>C(x)\subseteq \overline{C(x)}</m>, we must have <m>C(x)=\overline{C(x)}</m>. Thus <m>C(x)</m> is closed. 
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, to see that the components <m>C(x)</m> are disjoint, we will show that <m>C(x)\cap C(y)\ne \emptyset\implies C(x)=C(y)</m>. If <m>C(x)\cap C(y)\ne \emptyset</m>, then <m>C(x)\cup C(y)</m> is a connected set containing <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Since <m>C(x)</m> is maximally connected, we must have <m>C(x)\cup C(y)=C(x)</m>, and thus <m>C(y)\subseteq C(x)</m>. The same argument shows <m>C(x)\subseteq C(y)</m>. Thus <m>C(x)=C(y)</m>. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The proof here is exactly as with connected components. Again, we use the fact that the union of path-connected sets sharing a common point is path connected. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose <m>A</m> is connected. If <m>A\cap C\ne\emptyset</m>, then <m>A\cup C</m> is connected by. Since <m>C</m> is maximally connected, we have <m>A\cup C=C</m>. Thus <m>A\subseteq C</m>. A similar argument applies to path-connected components. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>C_p(x)</m> is connected and <m>C(x)</m> is the union of all connected sets containing <m>x</m>, we have <m>C_p(x)\subseteq C(x)</m>. Since <m>C(x)=C(y)</m> for all <m>y\in C(x)</m>, we further have <m>C_p(y)\subseteq C(x)</m> for all <m>y\in C(x)</m>. It follows easily that <m>C(x)=\bigcup_{y\in C(x)}C_p(y)</m>. That this union is disjoint follows from (3).
