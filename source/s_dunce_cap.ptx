              Fix a positive integer <m>n</m>, let <m>\alpha=2\pi/n</m>, and let <m>f_\alpha\colon S^1\rightarrow S^1</m> be the rotation by <m>\alpha</m> map: <ie/>, for a point <m>P=(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\in S^1</m>, we have <m>f_\alpha(P)=(\cos(\theta+2\pi/n), \sin(\theta+2\pi/n))</m>.

                The <term><m>n</m>-fold dunce cap</term> is the quotient <m>X</m> of <m>B^2</m> obtained by identifying any two points <m>P,Q\in S^1</m> satisfying <m>f_\alpha(P)=f_{\alpha}(Q)</m>.

        <title>Normality of quotients</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>q\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a closed quotient map. If <m>X</m> is normal, then <m>Y</m> is normal. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                First we show that <m>Y</m> is a <m>T_1</m>-space. Since <m>q</m> is surjective, for all <m>y\in Y</m> we have <m>y=q(x)</m> for some <m>x\in X</m>. Since <m>X</m> is <m>T_1</m>, the set <m>\{x\}</m> is closed. Since <m>q</m> is a closed map, the set <m>\{y}=q(\{x\})</m> is closed. Thus <m>Y</m> is <m>T_1</m>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the <xref ref="th_regular_normal_equivalence" text="custom">alternate formulation of normality</xref>. Consider an inclusion <m>A\subseteq U\subseteq Y</m>, where <m>A</m> is closed and <m>U</m> is open. Taking preimages under <m>q</m> yields an inclusion <m>q^{-1}(A)\subseteq q^{-1}(U)</m>, where <m>q^{-1}(A)</m> is closed and <m>q^{-1}(U)</m> is open. Since <m>X</m> is normal there is an open set <m>W</m> satisfying <m>q^{-1}(A)\subseteq W\subseteq q^{-1}(U)</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not necessarily true that <m>q(W)</m> is open, since we can not guarantee that <m>W</m> is saturated.  However, since <m>X-W</m> is closed and <m>q</m> is a closed map, the image <m>q(X-W)</m> is closed in <m>Y</m>. Let <m>V=Y-q(X-W)</m>. Since <m>q(X-W)\supseteq q(X-q^{-1}(U))=X-U</m> (we use here that <m>q</m> is surjective), we have <m>V\subseteq U</m>. Since <m>f^{-1}(A)\subseteq W</m>, we see that <m>A\cap q(X-W)=\emptyset</m>, and thus <m>A\subseteq V</m>. We conclude that <m>V</m> is an open set satisfying <m>A\subseteq V\subseteq U</m>, showing that <m>Y</m> is normal.
