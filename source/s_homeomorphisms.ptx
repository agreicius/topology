  <title>Homeomorphisms</title>
  <p>
    Consider the two spaces <m>X=\{1,2\}</m> and <m>Y=\{3,4\}</m>, both equipped with the discrete topology. As sets they are clearly not equal; and yet considered as topological spaces they are essentially the same. Indeed, we call both spaces the discrete topological space on a set of two elements. The notion of a <em>homeomorphism</em> gives us a rigorous way of determining when two spaces are <q>essentially the same thing, topologically speaking</q>.

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces. A function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is a <term>homeomorphism</term> if the following conditions are satisfied:
      <ol>

          <p>
            <m>f</m> is continuous;

        <li>
          <p>

  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <p>
    You may have met analogs of the homeomorphism in other areas of mathematics: <eg />, in linear algebra or group theory. In category theory it is what is called an <em>isomorphism</em>. The basic idea is that once you decide what the <q>structure-preserving</q> maps are between objects (continuous functions for topological spaces, linear transformations for vector spaces, homomorphisms for groups), an isomorphism is essentially just an <em>invertible</em> structure-preserving map: a vector space isomorphism is an invertible linear transformation; a group isomorphism is an invertible group homomorphism. The only subtlety is that you want the inverse of this invertible function to also be structure preserving! For linear transformations and group homomorphisms this is automatic. Not so for continuous functions! The inverse of an invertible continuous function need not be continuous, as the example below illustrates.

<example xml:id="eg_homeomorphism_not_">
  <title>Homeomorphism: inverse must be continuous</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m> and <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> be the spaces obtained by equipping <m>\R</m> with the standard and discrete topologies, respectively. The identity function
      <md>

      <mrow>  x\amp\mapsto x </mrow>

      is clearly continuous and invertible. In fact, we have <m>\id_\R^{-1}=\id_\R</m>. However, <m>\id_\R\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m> is not continuous. Indeed, <m>U=[0,1)</m> is open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{disc}}</m>, but <m>\id_\R^{-1}(U)=[0,1)</m> is not open in <m>\R_{\operatorname{std}}</m>. Thus <m>\id_{\R_{\operatorname{disc}}}\colon \R_{\operatorname{std}}\rightarrow \R</m>
      is an invertible continuous function that is not a homeomorphism.

  <title>Homeomorphic equivalence relation </title>
  <p>
    For topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>, define the relation <m>X\sim Y</m> to mean <m>X</m> is homeomorphic to <m>Y</m>. This relation is an equivalence relation. That is, for all topological spaces <m>X, Y, Z</m> we have

    These three properties follow from the simple facts that (1) the identity map is a homeomorphism, (2) the inverse of a homeomorphism is a homeomomoprhism, (3) the composition of homeomorphisms is a homeomorphism.

<example xml:id="eg_R_interval">
  <title>All open intervals of <m>\R</m> are homeomorphic</title>

  <solution>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      The function <m>f\colon (0,1)\rightarrow (a,b)</m> defined as <m>f(x)=a+(b-a)x</m> is linear (hence continuous) and has continuous inverse <m>f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-a}{b-a}</m>.

      This is now the result of the fact that being homeomorphic is an equivalence relation. In more detail, from (1) we know that all finite open intervals are homeomorphic; this in conjunction with (2) shows that all finite open intervals are homemorphic to <m>\R</m>. From (3) we conclude that all half-finite intervals are homeomorphic to <m>\R</m>. Since any open interval is either finite, half-finite, or equal to <m>\R</m>, we conclude that all open intervals are homeomorphic.

        <li>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>f</m> is continous and invertible throughout. To be a homeomorphism we need <m>g=f^{-1}</m> to be continuous. Since <m>g(y)=x</m> if and only if <m>f(x)=y</m>, we see that <m>g^{-1}(A)=f(A)</m>. Thus <m>g</m> continuous if and only if <m>g^{-1}(U)</m> is open for all open <m>U\subseteq X</m>, if and only if <m>f(U)</m> is open for all open <m>U\subseteq X</m>, if and only if <m>f</m> is open. The same argument with <q>closed</q> replacing <q>open</q> shows <m>g</m> is continuous if and only if <m>f</m> is closed. The equivalence of (1)-(3) now follows.

    Don't be mislead by <xref ref="th_homeo_open_closed"/> into thinking that being an open continuous map is equivalent to being a closed continuous map; we need the additional assumption of invertibility to guarantee equivalence. As an example, consider any constant function from <m>\R</m> to itself: this is clearly continuous and closed, but not open.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fix any <m>i\in I</m>. We showed <m>\pi_i</m> is continuous in <xref ref="eg_cont_projections"/>. To see that <m>\pi_i</m> is surjective, given any <m>x_i\in X_i</m>, we have <m>\pi_i^{-1}(\{x_i\}=\{x_i\}\times \prod_{j\ne i} X_j</m>, which is nonempty. Lastly, suppose <m>U\subseteq X</m> is open. We wish to show that <m>\pi_i(U)</m> is open in <m>X_i</m>. To this end, given any <m>x_i=\pi_i(\boldx)\in \pi_i(U)</m>, we have <m>x\in B\subseteq U</m> for some open base set
            <me>
              B=\prod_{i\in I}U_i
            </me>,
            where <m>U_j</m> is open in <m>X_j</m> and <m>U_j=X_j</m> for all but finitely many <m>j</m>. But then <m>\pi_(\boldx)\in \pi_i(B)=U_i\subseteq \pi_i(U)</m>. Since <m>U_i</m> is open, we have shown that given any <m>x_i\in \pi_i(U)</m>, there is an open set <m>U_i</m> such that <m>x\in U_i\subseteq \pi_i(U)</m>. It follows that <m>\pi_i(U)</m> is open, as desired.   
          </p>
        </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          First observe that equality for elements <m>\boldx=(x_i)_{i\in I}, \boldy=(y_i)_{i\in I}</m> in <m>X</m> can be expressed in terms of the projection maps as follows:
          <me>
            \boldx=\boldy \iff x_i=y_i \text{ for all } i\in I \iff \pi_i(x)=\pi_i(y) \text{ for all } i\in I
          </me>.
        Using this fact, we see that given a function <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow X</m> we have
          <md>
            <mrow>f_i=\pi_i\circ f \text{ for all } i\in I \amp \iff f_i(y)=\pi_i(f(y)) \text{ for all } y\in Y, i\in I </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \iff f(y)=(f_i(y))_{i\in I} </mrow>
          </md>.
          Thus the function <m>f(y)=(f_i(y))_{i\in I}</m> is the unique function from <m>Y</m> to <m>X</m> satisfying <m>f_i=\pi_i\circ f</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. To see that this <m>f</m> is continuous, we show that <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open for any base open set <m>B\subseteq X</m>. For such a <m>B</m> we have <m>B=\prod_{j=1}^n U_{i_j}\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> for some open sets <m>U_{i_j}\subseteq X_{i_j}</m>,
          <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. Note that for all <m>1\leq j \leq n</m> we have 
          <me>
            \pi_{i_j}^{-1}(U_{i_j})=U_{i_j}\times \prod_{i\ne i_j}X_i
          </me>
          from which it follows that 
          <md>
            <mrow> B=\prod_{j=1}^n U_{i_j}\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i\amp = \bigcap_{j=1}^nU_{i_j}\times \prod_{i\ne i_j}X_i </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \bigcap_{j=1}^n\pi_{i_j}^{-1}(U_{i_j})</mrow>
          </md>. 
          Thus 
          <md>
            <mrow>f^{-1}(B) \amp =f^{-1}\left( \bigcap_{j=1}^n\pi_{i_j}^{-1}(U_{i_j})\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \bigcap_{j=1}^nf^{-1}(\pi_{i_j}^{-1}(U_{i_j}))</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \bigcap_{j=1}^n(\pi_{i_j}\circ f)^{-1}(U_{i_j}) \amp \left((\pi_{i_j}\circ f)^{-1}(A)=f^{-1}(\pi_{i_j}^{-1}(A)) \right)</mrow>  
            <mrow> \amp = \bigcap_{j=1}^nf_{i_j}^{-1}(U_{i_j}) \amp (f_i=\pi_i\circ f \text{ for all } i\in I)</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since each <m>f_{i_j}</m> is continuous, this last set is a finite intersection of open sets. Thus <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open, as desired.

        <p>
          Let <m>X'</m> together with continuous maps <m>\pi_i'\colon X\rightarrow X_i</m> be any other space that satisfies <xref ref="prod_top_universal" text="title"/>. Letting <m>Y</m> be the space <m>X'</m> together with its maps <m>\pi_i'</m>, there is a continuous function <m>f\colon X'\rightarrow X</m> satisfying <m>\pi_i'=\pi_i\circ f</m> for all <m>i</m>. Similarly, since <m>X'</m> also satisfies the product mapping property, taking <m>Y=X</m> along with its projection maps, we see there is a continuous map <m>g\colon X\rightarrow X'</m> satisfying <m>\pi_i=\pi_i'\circ g</m>.
          We claim <m>f\circ g=\id_X</m> and <m>g\circ f=\id_{X'}</m>: <ie />, <m>g=f^{-1}</m> is a continuous inverse of <m>f</m>, and thus <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism between <m>X'</m> and <m>X</m>.
          To see why this is true, we use the <em>uniqueness</em> claim in the product mapping property (twice). Indeed, the function <m>f\circ g\colon X\rightarrow X</m> is continuous and satisfies
          <me>
            \pi_i\circ (g\circ f)=(\pi_i\circ g)\circ f=\pi_i'\circ f=\pi_i
          </me>
          for all <m>i\in I</m>. But the function <m>\id_X\colon X\rightarrow X</m> also satisfies <m>\pi_i=\pi_i\circ\id_X</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. By the uniqueness claim of the product mapping property, we conclude <m>\id_X=f\circ g</m>, as desired. The proof that <m>g\circ f=\id_{X'}</m> is nearly identical, now applying the product mapping property to maps into <m>X'</m>.

<remark>
  <title>Universal mapping property of product space</title>
  <p>
    There is quite a bit to unpack in <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/>. The result is useful on a number of levels, some theoretical and some practical.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the practical side, the theorem provides us a nice tool for producing continuous functions of the form <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow \prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>: namely, all you need to do is provide continuous functions <m>f_i\colon Y\rightarrow X_i</m> for each <m>i\in I</m> and define <m>f(y)=(f_i(y))_{i\in I}</m>. Or similarly, given a function <m>f\colon Y\rightarrow \prod_{i\in I} X_i</m>, to show <m>f</m> is continuous, it suffices to show that each component function <m>f_i=\pi_i\circ f</m> is continuous. You may have seen this property at work in an analysis or multivariable calculus course. For example, sometimes in these settings a function 
    <md>
      <mrow>f\colon \R \amp \rightarrow \R^n</mrow>
      <mrow>t \amp\mapsto  (f_1(t),f_2(t),\dots, f_n(t))</mrow>
    </md>
    is simply defined to be continuous if the component functions <m>f_i\colon \R\rightarrow \R</m> are continuous for each <m>i</m>. Thanks to <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/> we understand that this is equivalent to <m>f</m> being continuous with respect to the standard topology on <m>\R</m> and the product topology on <m>\R^n</m> (which is equal to the standard topology on <m>\R^n</m>).  
  </p>
  <p>
    On the theoretical side, the theorem identifies precisely what is so special about the product topology. Namely, it is the unique (up to homeomorphism) space satisfying the <xref ref="prod_top_universal" text="title"/>.  The property establishes <m>X</m> with the product topology as the <em>category theoretic</em> product of the spaces <m>X_i</m>. You may have seen analogues of this type of object in other categories (<eg/>, category of groups or category of rings).

    We leave most of this as an exercise. Note that to show <m>f</m> is continuous, by <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/> we need only show that the two <q>component functions</q> 
    <md>
      <mrow>f_1=\pi_1\circ f\colon \R^2\amp \rightarrow \R \amp f_2=\pi_2\circ f\colon \R^2\amp \rightarrow \R </mrow>
      <mrow>(r,\theta)\amp \mapsto r\cos\theta \amp (r,\theta)\amp \mapsto r\sin\theta </mrow>
    </md>
    are continuous. To see that <m>f_1</m> is continuous, note that we have 
    <me>
      f_1=m\circ g
    </me>
    where <m>g\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R^2 </m> is the function <m>g(r,\theta)=(r,\cos \theta)</m> and <m>m\colon \R^2\rightarrow \R</m> is the multiplication map <m>m(x,y)=xy</m>. Both <m>g</m> and <m>m</m> are continuous: the two component functions of <m>g</m> are <m>\pi_1\circ g=\pi_1</m> and <m>\pi_2\circ g=\cos\circ \pi_2</m>, both of which are continuous; we showed in homework that more generally scalar multiplication <m>m\colon \R\times \R^n\rightarrow \R^n</m> is continuous for any <m>n</m>.

      Let <m>X=[0,1)\subseteq \R</m> and  <m>S^1=\{(x,y)\in \R^2\colon x^2+y^2=1\}\subseteq \R^2</m>, and equip each set with the subspace topology inherited from <m>\R</m> (resp. <m>\R^2</m>) with its Euclidean topology.

    <p>
      Prove: the function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow S^1</m> defined as <m>f(t)=(\cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t)</m> is continuous and invertible, but not a homeomorphism.

  <solution>
    <p>
      Recall first that on <m>\R^2=\R\times \R</m> the product topology, Euclidean metric topology, and box topology are all equal.
      Since <m>f_1(x)=\cos 2\pi t</m> and <m>f_2(x)=\sin 2\pi t</m> are continuous, it follows from <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/> that the map <m>g\colon [0,1)\rightarrow \R\times \R=\R^2</m> is continuous. Next, since <m>g=i\circ f</m>,
      where <m>i\colon S^1\hookrightarrow \R^2</m>, it follows that <m>f</m> is continuous: indeed, for any open set <m>U\subseteq S^1</m>, we have <m>U=U'\cap S^1</m> for some open <m>U'\subseteq \R^2</m>, and <m>f^{-1}(U)=g^{-1}(U')</m>, which is open since <m>g</m> is continuous.
    </p>

      The usual trigonometric arguments show that <m>f</m> is injective and surjective. However, <m>f</m> is not open, and hence not a homeomorphism. Indeed, let <m>U=[0,1/2)</m>, which is open in <m>[0,1)</m>. The image <m>f(U)</m> is easily seen to be the upper half of the circle minus the point <m>Q=(-1,0)</m>: in particular, all points <m>f(U)</m> have nonnegative <m>y</m>-coordinates. On the other hand, we have <m>(1,0)\in f(U)</m> and with respect to the subspace topology on <m>S^1</m> any open set containing <m>(1,0)</m> contains elements of <m>S^1</m> whose <m>y</m>-coordinate is negative. It follows that <m>f(U)</m> is not open.

  In light of <xref ref="th_product_universal_prop"/>, it is natural to ask whether given topological spaces <m>(X_i, \mathcal{T}_i)</m> there is a space <m>X</m> with continuous maps <m>X_i\rightarrow X</m> that satisfies a dual mapping property to that of the product.
