    We introduced the notions of <xref ref="d_first_countable" text="custom">first countability</xref> and <xref ref="d_second_countable" text="custom">second countability</xref> during our discussion of compactness in metric spaces (<xref ref="s_compact_metric" text="global"/>). In this section we will look more closely at these and related properties.

        Since we will be dealing with countability questions, it will be useful to record some important countability properties. You may use the following facts in your arguments without any justification.

            <li>

            Assume <m>X</m> is countable. A nonempty open set of <m>X</m> is of the form <m>U=X-\{x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n\}</m> for some <m>n</m>. It follows that the nonempty open sets of <m>X</m> are in bijection with the set of all finite subsets of <m>X</m>. By <xref ref="rm_countable"/>, this collection is countable.

            Assume <m>X</m> is first countable. Take any <m>x\in X</m> and let <m>\{V_n\}</m> be a countable local basis at <m>x</m>. By definition we have <m>V_n^c</m> finite for each <m>n</m>, in which case <m>\{x\}\cup \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n^c</m> is countable, being a countable union of countable sets. I claim <m>X=\{x\}\cup \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n^c</m>, proving <m>X</m> is countable. Indeed, take any <m>y\ne x</m>. The set <m>U=X-\{y\}</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m>. Thus we have <m>V_n\subseteq X-\{y\}</m> for some <m>n</m>, in which case <m>\{y\}\subseteq V_n^c</m>, or equivalently, <m>y\in V_n^c</m>, as desired.

                    Given <m>x\in X</m> let <m>\{U_n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> be a countable local basis at <m>x</m>. For each <m>n\geq 1</m>, define <m>V_n=U_1\cap U_2\cap\cdots \cap U_n</m>. (Note that <m>V_n\ne\emptyset</m> since <m>x\in V_n</m>.) We have <m>V_n\supseteq V_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n\geq 1</m>. Furthermore, given any open <m>U\ni x</m>, we have 
                    <m>V_n\subseteq U_n\subseteq U</m>. Thus <m>\{V_n\}</m> forms a nested local basis.

                First, it is easy to see that in any space we have <m>A\subseteq \operatorname{sc} A\subseteq \overline{A}</m>. Thus in any topological space, if <m>A</m> is closed, then we have <m>A=\operatorname{sc} A=\overline{A}</m>, and thus <m>A</m> is sequentially closed. Now assume <m>A</m> is sequentially closed, and take <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>.  Using (1), we pick a a local basis <m>\{V_n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> at <m>x</m> that is nested: <ie/>, for all <m>n\geq 1</m>, <m>V_n\supseteq V_{n+1}</m>. Now, for each <m>n\in \Z_+</m> pick an element <m>x_n\in V_n\cap A</m>. We have <m>x_n\rightarrow x</m>: indeed, if <m>U\ni x</m> is any open set containing <m>x</m>, then <m>V_N\subseteq U</m> for some <m>n</m>, in which case  <m>x_k\in V_k\subseteq U</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>. Since <m>A</m> is sequentially compact, we have <m>x\in A</m>. Thus <m>\overline{A}\subseteq A</m>, and we conclude that <m>A=\overline{A}</m>.

            <li>
                <p>
                    The forward direction is true in any topological space, as we have shown before. Let's prove the reverse direction. Assume <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is sequentially continuous. Fix any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>f(x)=y\in Y</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that there is no open set <m>V\ni x</m> such that <m>f(V)\subseteq U</m>. Let <m>\{V_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a nested local basis at <m>x</m>. Since <m>f(V_n)\not\subseteq U</m> for all <m>n</m>, we can find an <m>x_n\in V_n</m> such that <m>f(x_n)\notin U</m>. The sequence <m>(x_n)</m> converges to <m>x</m>: indeed, given any open <m>V</m> containing <m>x</m> there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>V_N\subseteq V</m>. Since the local basis is nested, we have <m>V_k\subseteq V_N\subseteq V</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>, and hence <m>x_k\in V</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>. However, it is clear that <m>(f(x_n))</m> does not converge to <m>f(x)=y</m>, since by construction no <m>f(x_n)</m> lies in the open set <m>U</m>. This contradicts the fact that <m>f</m> is sequentially compact. We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous.

    <title>Implications among countability axioms</title>
    <p>
        Without further assumptions on the space <m>X</m>, the implications described in (1) of <xref ref="th_second_countable"/> are the only ones guaranteed. Figure <xref ref="fig_count"/> summarizes this situation. By contrast <xref ref="fig_count_metric"/> indicates the logical relations between the countability axioms when <m>X</m> is a metric space. Notice that even in this case, first countable is strictly weaker than second countable.

        To see that <m>X</m> is not second countable, consider any basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m> of <m>X</m>. For each <m>x\in \R</m>, we can find a basis element <m>B_x\in \mathcal{B}</m> such that <m>x\in B_x\subseteq [x,x+1)</m>. Note that since <m>\inf B_x=x</m> for such a <m>B_x</m>, the map <m>x\mapsto B_x</m> defines an injection of <m>\R</m> into <m>\mathcal{B}</m>: <m>B_x=B_y\implies \inf B_x=\inf B_y\implies x=y</m>. This proves that <m>\mathcal{B}</m> is uncountable. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, by (2) of <xref ref="th_second_countable"/> we know that <m>\R_\ell</m> is not metrizable, since it is separable but not second countable. See Munkres for a proof that <m>\R_\ell</m> is also Lindelöf.

            Give an example of a first countable space <m>X</m> and continuous function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> such that <m>f(X)</m> is not first countable.

    <solution>
        <p>
            Consider the identity function <m>\id\colon \R\rightarrow \R</m>, where the codomain is given the cofinite topology and the domain is given the standard topology. (This is continuous since the standard topology is finer than the cofinite topology.) Since the standard topology is metrizable, the domain is first countable. On the other hand, we saw in <xref ref="eg_cofinite_first_countable"/> that any uncountable set is not first countable with respect to the cofinite topology.

    </p>

<solution>
    <p>
        According to (3) of <xref ref="th_first_second_countable_subspace_product"/> an uncountable product of nontrivial spaces is not first countable. Thus <m>X</m> is not first countable, in which case it is also not metrizable.
